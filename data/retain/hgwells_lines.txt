35	
35	The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him)
35	was expounding a recondite matter to us. His grey eyes shone and
35	twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The
35	fire burned brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent
35	lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and
35	passed in our glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and
35	caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that
35	luxurious after-dinner atmosphere when thought roams gracefully
35	free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this
35	way--marking the points with a lean forefinger--as we sat and lazily
35	admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it)
35	and his fecundity.
35	
35	'You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two
35	ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for
35	instance, they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.'
35	
35	'Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?'
35	said Filby, an argumentative person with red hair.
35	
35	'I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable
35	ground for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You
35	know of course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_,
35	has no real existence. They taught you that? Neither has a
35	mathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions.'
35	
35	'That is all right,' said the Psychologist.
35	
35	'Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a
35	real existence.'
35	
35	'There I object,' said Filby. 'Of course a solid body may exist. All
35	real things--'
35	
35	'So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an _instantaneous_
35	cube exist?'
35	
35	'Don't follow you,' said Filby.
35	
35	'Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real
35	existence?'
35	
35	Filby became pensive. 'Clearly,' the Time Traveller proceeded, 'any
35	real body must have extension in _four_ directions: it must have
35	Length, Breadth, Thickness, and--Duration. But through a natural
35	infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we
35	incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions,
35	three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time.
35	There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between
35	the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that
35	our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the
35	latter from the beginning to the end of our lives.'
35	
35	'That,' said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight
35	his cigar over the lamp; 'that ... very clear indeed.'
35	
35	'Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,'
35	continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of
35	cheerfulness. 'Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension,
35	though some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know
35	they mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. _There is
35	no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space
35	except that our consciousness moves along it_. But some foolish
35	people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea. You have all
35	heard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?'
35	
35	'_I_ have not,' said the Provincial Mayor.
35	
35	'It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is
35	spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length,
35	Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to
35	three planes, each at right angles to the others. But some
35	philosophical people have been asking why _three_ dimensions
35	particularly--why not another direction at right angles to the other
35	three?--and have even tried to construct a Four-Dimension geometry.
35	Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding this to the New York
35	Mathematical Society only a month or so ago. You know how on a flat
35	surface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a figure of
35	a three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by models
35	of three dimensions they could represent one of four--if they could
35	master the perspective of the thing. See?'
35	
35	'I think so,' murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his
35	brows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one
35	who repeats mystic words. 'Yes, I think I see it now,' he said after
35	some time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.
35	
35	'Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this
35	geometry of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results
35	are curious. For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight
35	years old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another at
35	twenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections, as it
35	were, Three-Dimensional representations of his Four-Dimensioned
35	being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing.
35	
35	'Scientific people,' proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause
35	required for the proper assimilation of this, 'know very well that
35	Time is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram,
35	a weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the
35	movement of the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night
35	it fell, then this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to
35	here. Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the
35	dimensions of Space generally recognized? But certainly it traced
35	such a line, and that line, therefore, we must conclude was along
35	the Time-Dimension.'
35	
35	'But,' said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, 'if
35	Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why
35	has it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot
35	we move in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?'
35	
35	The Time Traveller smiled. 'Are you sure we can move freely in
35	Space? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,
35	and men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two
35	dimensions. But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.'
35	
35	'Not exactly,' said the Medical Man. 'There are balloons.'
35	
35	'But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the
35	inequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical
35	movement.'
35	
35	'Still they could move a little up and down,' said the Medical Man.
35	
35	'Easier, far easier down than up.'
35	
35	'And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the
35	present moment.'
35	
35	'My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where
35	the whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the
35	present moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have
35	no dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform
35	velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel _down_
35	if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth's surface.'
35	
35	'But the great difficulty is this,' interrupted the Psychologist.
35	'You _can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot
35	move about in Time.'
35	
35	'That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say
35	that we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling
35	an incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence:
35	I become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of
35	course we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any
35	more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the
35	ground. But a civilized man is better off than the savage in this
35	respect. He can go up against gravitation in a balloon, and why
35	should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or
35	accelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even turn about
35	and travel the other way?'
35	
35	'Oh, _this_,' began Filby, 'is all--'
35	
35	'Why not?' said the Time Traveller.
35	
35	'It's against reason,' said Filby.
35	
35	'What reason?' said the Time Traveller.
35	
35	'You can show black is white by argument,' said Filby, 'but you will
35	never convince me.'
35	
35	'Possibly not,' said the Time Traveller. 'But now you begin to see
35	the object of my investigations into the geometry of Four
35	Dimensions. Long ago I had a vague inkling of a machine--'
35	
35	'To travel through Time!' exclaimed the Very Young Man.
35	
35	'That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time,
35	as the driver determines.'
35	
35	Filby contented himself with laughter.
35	
35	'But I have experimental verification,' said the Time Traveller.
35	
35	'It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,' the
35	Psychologist suggested. 'One might travel back and verify the
35	accepted account of the Battle of Hastings, for instance!'
35	
35	'Don't you think you would attract attention?' said the Medical Man.
35	'Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.'
35	
35	'One might get one's Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,'
35	the Very Young Man thought.
35	
35	'In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go.
35	The German scholars have improved Greek so much.'
35	
35	'Then there is the future,' said the Very Young Man. 'Just think!
35	One might invest all one's money, leave it to accumulate at
35	interest, and hurry on ahead!'
35	
35	'To discover a society,' said I, 'erected on a strictly communistic
35	basis.'
35	
35	'Of all the wild extravagant theories!' began the Psychologist.
35	
35	'Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until--'
35	
35	'Experimental verification!' cried I. 'You are going to verify
35	_that_?'
35	
35	'The experiment!' cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary.
35	
35	'Let's see your experiment anyhow,' said the Psychologist, 'though
35	it's all humbug, you know.'
35	
35	The Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly,
35	and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly
35	out of the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long
35	passage to his laboratory.
35	
35	The Psychologist looked at us. 'I wonder what he's got?'
35	
35	'Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,' said the Medical Man, and
35	Filby tried to tell us about a conjurer he had seen at Burslem; but
35	before he had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and
35	Filby's anecdote collapsed.
35	
35	The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering
35	metallic framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very
35	delicately made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent
35	crystalline substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that
35	follows--unless his explanation is to be accepted--is an absolutely
35	unaccountable thing. He took one of the small octagonal tables that
35	were scattered about the room, and set it in front of the fire, with
35	two legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed the mechanism.
35	Then he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other object on the
35	table was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell upon
35	the model. There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in
35	brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that
35	the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair
35	nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between
35	the Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat behind him, looking
35	over his shoulder. The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor watched
35	him in profile from the right, the Psychologist from the left. The
35	Very Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. We were all on the
35	alert. It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however
35	subtly conceived and however adroitly done, could have been played
35	upon us under these conditions.
35	
35	The Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. 'Well?'
35	said the Psychologist.
35	
35	'This little affair,' said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows
35	upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus,
35	'is only a model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through
35	time. You will notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there
35	is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in
35	some way unreal.' He pointed to the part with his finger. 'Also,
35	here is one little white lever, and here is another.'
35	
35	The Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing.
35	'It's beautifully made,' he said.
35	
35	'It took two years to make,' retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when
35	we had all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: 'Now I
35	want you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over,
35	sends the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses
35	the motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller.
35	Presently I am going to press the lever, and off the machine will
35	go. It will vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a
35	good look at the thing. Look at the table too, and satisfy
35	yourselves there is no trickery. I don't want to waste this model,
35	and then be told I'm a quack.'
35	
35	There was a minute's pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to
35	speak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth
35	his finger towards the lever. 'No,' he said suddenly. 'Lend me your
35	hand.' And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual's
35	hand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it
35	was the Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine
35	on its interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am
35	absolutely certain there was no trickery. There was a breath of
35	wind, and the lamp flame jumped. One of the candles on the mantel
35	was blown out, and the little machine suddenly swung round, became
35	indistinct, was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps, as an eddy of
35	faintly glittering brass and ivory; and it was gone--vanished! Save
35	for the lamp the table was bare.
35	
35	Everyone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.
35	
35	The Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked
35	under the table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully.
35	'Well?' he said, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then,
35	getting up, he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his
35	back to us began to fill his pipe.
35	
35	We stared at each other. 'Look here,' said the Medical Man, 'are you
35	in earnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine
35	has travelled into time?'
35	
35	'Certainly,' said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at
35	the fire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the
35	Psychologist's face. (The Psychologist, to show that he was not
35	unhinged, helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.)
35	'What is more, I have a big machine nearly finished in there'--he
35	indicated the laboratory--'and when that is put together I mean to
35	have a journey on my own account.'
35	
35	'You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?'
35	said Filby.
35	
35	'Into the future or the past--I don't, for certain, know which.'
35	
35	After an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. 'It must have
35	gone into the past if it has gone anywhere,' he said.
35	
35	'Why?' said the Time Traveller.
35	
35	'Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it
35	travelled into the future it would still be here all this time,
35	since it must have travelled through this time.'
35	
35	'But,' I said, 'If it travelled into the past it would have been
35	visible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when we
35	were here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!'
35	
35	'Serious objections,' remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air of
35	impartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller.
35	
35	'Not a bit,' said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: 'You
35	think. You can explain that. It's presentation below the threshold,
35	you know, diluted presentation.'
35	
35	'Of course,' said the Psychologist, and reassured us. 'That's a
35	simple point of psychology. I should have thought of it. It's plain
35	enough, and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor
35	can we appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of
35	a wheel spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is
35	travelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than
35	we are, if it gets through a minute while we get through a second,
35	the impression it creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or
35	one-hundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling in
35	time. That's plain enough.' He passed his hand through the space in
35	which the machine had been. 'You see?' he said, laughing.
35	
35	We sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the
35	Time Traveller asked us what we thought of it all.
35	
35	'It sounds plausible enough to-night,' said the Medical Man; 'but
35	wait until to-morrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.'
35	
35	'Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?' asked the Time
35	Traveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the
35	way down the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember
35	vividly the flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette,
35	the dance of the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but
35	incredulous, and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger
35	edition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before
35	our eyes. Parts were of nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly
35	been filed or sawn out of rock crystal. The thing was generally
35	complete, but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the
35	bench beside some sheets of drawings, and I took one up for a better
35	look at it. Quartz it seemed to be.
35	
35	'Look here,' said the Medical Man, 'are you perfectly serious?
35	Or is this a trick--like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?'
35	
35	'Upon that machine,' said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp
35	aloft, 'I intend to explore time. Is that plain? I was never more
35	serious in my life.'
35	
35	None of us quite knew how to take it.
35	
35	I caught Filby's eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and he
35	winked at me solemnly.
35	
35	
35	
35	
35	II
35	
35	
35	I think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time
35	Machine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who
35	are too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round
35	him; you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in
35	ambush, behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and
35	explained the matter in the Time Traveller's words, we should have
35	shown _him_ far less scepticism. For we should have perceived his
35	motives; a pork butcher could understand Filby. But the Time
35	Traveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements, and we
35	distrusted him. Things that would have made the frame of a less
35	clever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do things
35	too easily. The serious people who took him seriously never felt
35	quite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trusting
35	their reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a
35	nursery with egg-shell china. So I don't think any of us said very
35	much about time travelling in the interval between that Thursday and
35	the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of
35	our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical incredibleness,
35	the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it
35	suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied with the
35	trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the Medical Man,
35	whom I met on Friday at the Linnaean. He said he had seen a similar
35	thing at Tubingen, and laid considerable stress on the blowing out
35	of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not explain.
35	
35	The next Thursday I went again to Richmond--I suppose I was one of
35	the Time Traveller's most constant guests--and, arriving late, found
35	four or five men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical
35	Man was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand
35	and his watch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller,
35	and--'It's half-past seven now,' said the Medical Man. 'I suppose
35	we'd better have dinner?'
35	
35	'Where's----?' said I, naming our host.
35	
35	'You've just come? It's rather odd. He's unavoidably detained. He
35	asks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he's not
35	back. Says he'll explain when he comes.'
35	
35	'It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,' said the Editor of a
35	well-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.
35	
35	The Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself
35	who had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the
35	Editor aforementioned, a certain journalist, and another--a quiet,
35	shy man with a beard--whom I didn't know, and who, as far as my
35	observation went, never opened his mouth all the evening. There was
35	some speculation at the dinner-table about the Time Traveller's
35	absence, and I suggested time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit.
35	The Editor wanted that explained to him, and the Psychologist
35	volunteered a wooden account of the 'ingenious paradox and trick' we
35	had witnessed that day week. He was in the midst of his exposition
35	when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise. I
35	was facing the door, and saw it first. 'Hallo!' I said. 'At last!'
35	And the door opened wider, and the Time Traveller stood before us.
35	I gave a cry of surprise. 'Good heavens! man, what's the matter?'
35	cried the Medical Man, who saw him next. And the whole tableful
35	turned towards the door.
35	
35	He was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and
35	smeared with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it
35	seemed to me greyer--either with dust and dirt or because its colour
35	had actually faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown
35	cut on it--a cut half healed; his expression was haggard and drawn,
35	as by intense suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway,
35	as if he had been dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room.
35	He walked with just such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps.
35	We stared at him in silence, expecting him to speak.
35	
35	He said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a
35	motion towards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and
35	pushed it towards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good:
35	for he looked round the table, and the ghost of his old smile
35	flickered across his face. 'What on earth have you been up to, man?'
35	said the Doctor. The Time Traveller did not seem to hear. 'Don't let
35	me disturb you,' he said, with a certain faltering articulation.
35	'I'm all right.' He stopped, held out his glass for more, and took
35	it off at a draught. 'That's good,' he said. His eyes grew brighter,
35	and a faint colour came into his cheeks. His glance flickered over
35	our faces with a certain dull approval, and then went round the warm
35	and comfortable room. Then he spoke again, still as it were feeling
35	his way among his words. 'I'm going to wash and dress, and then I'll
35	come down and explain things ... Save me some of that mutton. I'm
35	starving for a bit of meat.'
35	
35	He looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he
35	was all right. The Editor began a question. 'Tell you presently,'
35	said the Time Traveller. 'I'm--funny! Be all right in a minute.'
35	
35	He put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again
35	I remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall,
35	and standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had
35	nothing on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the
35	door closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered
35	how he detested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my
35	mind was wool-gathering. Then, 'Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent
35	Scientist,' I heard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in
35	headlines. And this brought my attention back to the bright
35	dinner-table.
35	
35	'What's the game?' said the Journalist. 'Has he been doing the
35	Amateur Cadger? I don't follow.' I met the eye of the Psychologist,
35	and read my own interpretation in his face. I thought of the Time
35	Traveller limping painfully upstairs. I don't think any one else had
35	noticed his lameness.
35	
35	The first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical
35	Man, who rang the bell--the Time Traveller hated to have servants
35	waiting at dinner--for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his
35	knife and fork with a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The
35	dinner was resumed. Conversation was exclamatory for a little while,
35	with gaps of wonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his
35	curiosity. 'Does our friend eke out his modest income with a
35	crossing? or has he his Nebuchadnezzar phases?' he inquired. 'I feel
35	assured it's this business of the Time Machine,' I said, and took up
35	the Psychologist's account of our previous meeting. The new guests
35	were frankly incredulous. The Editor raised objections. 'What _was_
35	this time travelling? A man couldn't cover himself with dust by
35	rolling in a paradox, could he?' And then, as the idea came home to
35	him, he resorted to caricature. Hadn't they any clothes-brushes in
35	the Future? The Journalist too, would not believe at any price, and
35	joined the Editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole
35	thing. They were both the new kind of journalist--very joyous,
35	irreverent young men. 'Our Special Correspondent in the Day
35	after To-morrow reports,' the Journalist was saying--or rather
35	shouting--when the Time Traveller came back. He was dressed in
35	ordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look remained
35	of the change that had startled me.
35	
35	'I say,' said the Editor hilariously, 'these chaps here say you have
35	been travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all about
35	little Rosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?'
35	
35	The Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a
35	word. He smiled quietly, in his old way. 'Where's my mutton?' he
35	said. 'What a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!'
35	
35	'Story!' cried the Editor.
35	
35	'Story be damned!' said the Time Traveller. 'I want something to
35	eat. I won't say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries.
35	Thanks. And the salt.'
35	
35	'One word,' said I. 'Have you been time travelling?'
35	
35	'Yes,' said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his
35	head.
35	
35	'I'd give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,' said the Editor.
35	The Time Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang
35	it with his fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been
35	staring at his face, started convulsively, and poured him wine.
35	The rest of the dinner was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden
35	questions kept on rising to my lips, and I dare say it was the same
35	with the others. The Journalist tried to relieve the tension by
35	telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The Time Traveller devoted his
35	attention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite of a tramp.
35	The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched the Time Traveller
35	through his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even more clumsy than
35	usual, and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of
35	sheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller pushed his plate away,
35	and looked round us. 'I suppose I must apologize,' he said. 'I was
35	simply starving. I've had a most amazing time.' He reached out his
35	hand for a cigar, and cut the end. 'But come into the smoking-room.
35	It's too long a story to tell over greasy plates.' And ringing the
35	bell in passing, he led the way into the adjoining room.
35	
35	'You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?' he
35	said to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new
35	guests.
35	
35	'But the thing's a mere paradox,' said the Editor.
35	
35	'I can't argue to-night. I don't mind telling you the story, but
35	I can't argue. I will,' he went on, 'tell you the story of what
35	has happened to me, if you like, but you must refrain from
35	interruptions. I want to tell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like
35	lying. So be it! It's true--every word of it, all the same. I was in
35	my laboratory at four o'clock, and since then ... I've lived eight
35	days ... such days as no human being ever lived before! I'm nearly
35	worn out, but I shan't sleep till I've told this thing over to you.
35	Then I shall go to bed. But no interruptions! Is it agreed?'
35	
35	'Agreed,' said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed 'Agreed.' And
35	with that the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth.
35	He sat back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man.
35	Afterwards he got more animated. In writing it down I feel with only
35	too much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink--and, above all, my
35	own inadequacy--to express its quality. You read, I will suppose,
35	attentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker's white,
35	sincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the
35	intonation of his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed
35	the turns of his story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the
35	candles in the smoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face
35	of the Journalist and the legs of the Silent Man from the knees
35	downward were illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at each
35	other. After a time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the
35	Time Traveller's face.
35	
35

35	
35	III
35	
35	
35	'I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time
35	Machine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the
35	workshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of
35	the ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of
35	it's sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday, but on Friday,
35	when the putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the
35	nickel bars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get
35	remade; so that the thing was not complete until this morning. It
35	was at ten o'clock to-day that the first of all Time Machines began
35	its career. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put
35	one more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the
35	saddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels
35	much the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then. I took
35	the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other,
35	pressed the first, and almost immediately the second. I seemed to
35	reel; I felt a nightmare sensation of falling; and, looking round,
35	I saw the laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened? For
35	a moment I suspected that my intellect had tricked me. Then I noted
35	the clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minute
35	or so past ten; now it was nearly half-past three!
35	
35	'I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both
35	hands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went
35	dark. Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing
35	me, towards the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to
35	traverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room
35	like a rocket. I pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The
35	night came like the turning out of a lamp, and in another moment
35	came to-morrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter
35	and ever fainter. To-morrow night came black, then day again, night
35	again, day again, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filled
35	my ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind.
35	
35	'I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time
35	travelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling
35	exactly like that one has upon a switchback--of a helpless headlong
35	motion! I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent
35	smash. As I put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a
35	black wing. The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to
35	fall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky,
35	leaping it every minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed
35	the laboratory had been destroyed and I had come into the open air.
35	I had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too
35	fast to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest snail that
35	ever crawled dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling succession of
35	darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then, in the
35	intermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her
35	quarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling
35	stars. Presently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, the
35	palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness;
35	the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminous
35	color like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak
35	of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter fluctuating
35	band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and then a
35	brighter circle flickering in the blue.
35	
35	'The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hill-side
35	upon which this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me
35	grey and dim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour,
35	now brown, now green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away.
35	I saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams.
35	The whole surface of the earth seemed changed--melting and flowing
35	under my eyes. The little hands upon the dials that registered my
35	speed raced round faster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun
35	belt swayed up and down, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or
35	less, and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute; and
35	minute by minute the white snow flashed across the world, and
35	vanished, and was followed by the bright, brief green of spring.
35	
35	'The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They
35	merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked
35	indeed a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to
35	account. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a
35	kind of madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At
35	first I scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but
35	these new sensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions
35	grew up in my mind--a certain curiosity and therewith a certain
35	dread--until at last they took complete possession of me. What
35	strange developments of humanity, what wonderful advances upon our
35	rudimentary civilization, I thought, might not appear when I came to
35	look nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated
35	before my eyes! I saw great and splendid architecture rising about
35	me, more massive than any buildings of our own time, and yet, as it
35	seemed, built of glimmer and mist. I saw a richer green flow up the
35	hill-side, and remain there, without any wintry intermission. Even
35	through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair. And so
35	my mind came round to the business of stopping.
35	
35	'The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some
35	substance in the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long
35	as I travelled at a high velocity through time, this scarcely
35	mattered; I was, so to speak, attenuated--was slipping like a vapour
35	through the interstices of intervening substances! But to come to
35	a stop involved the jamming of myself, molecule by molecule, into
35	whatever lay in my way; meant bringing my atoms into such intimate
35	contact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical
35	reaction--possibly a far-reaching explosion--would result, and blow
35	myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions--into the
35	Unknown. This possibility had occurred to me again and again while I
35	was making the machine; but then I had cheerfully accepted it as an
35	unavoidable risk--one of the risks a man has got to take! Now the
35	risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the same cheerful light.
35	The fact is that, insensibly, the absolute strangeness of everything,
35	the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above all, the
35	feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerve. I told
35	myself that I could never stop, and with a gust of petulance I
35	resolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I lugged over
35	the lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over, and I was
35	flung headlong through the air.
35	
35	'There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have
35	been stunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me,
35	and I was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine.
35	Everything still seemed grey, but presently I remarked that the
35	confusion in my ears was gone. I looked round me. I was on what
35	seemed to be a little lawn in a garden, surrounded by rhododendron
35	bushes, and I noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were
35	dropping in a shower under the beating of the hail-stones. The
35	rebounding, dancing hail hung in a cloud over the machine, and drove
35	along the ground like smoke. In a moment I was wet to the skin.
35	""Fine hospitality,"" said I, ""to a man who has travelled innumerable
35	years to see you.""
35	
35	'Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and
35	looked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white
35	stone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy
35	downpour. But all else of the world was invisible.
35	
35	'My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail
35	grew thinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very
35	large, for a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white
35	marble, in shape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings,
35	instead of being carried vertically at the sides, were spread so
35	that it seemed to hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of
35	bronze, and was thick with verdigris. It chanced that the face was
35	towards me; the sightless eyes seemed to watch me; there was the
35	faint shadow of a smile on the lips. It was greatly weather-worn,
35	and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease. I stood
35	looking at it for a little space--half a minute, perhaps, or half an
35	hour. It seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before it
35	denser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from it for a moment and
35	saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and that the sky was
35	lightening with the promise of the sun.
35	
35	'I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full
35	temerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear when
35	that hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn? What might not have
35	happened to men? What if cruelty had grown into a common passion?
35	What if in this interval the race had lost its manliness and had
35	developed into something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly
35	powerful? I might seem some old-world savage animal, only the more
35	dreadful and disgusting for our common likeness--a foul creature to
35	be incontinently slain.
35	
35	'Already I saw other vast shapes--huge buildings with intricate
35	parapets and tall columns, with a wooded hill-side dimly creeping
35	in upon me through the lessening storm. I was seized with a panic
35	fear. I turned frantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to
35	readjust it. As I did so the shafts of the sun smote through the
35	thunderstorm. The grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like
35	the trailing garments of a ghost. Above me, in the intense blue
35	of the summer sky, some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into
35	nothingness. The great buildings about me stood out clear and
35	distinct, shining with the wet of the thunderstorm, and picked out
35	in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses. I
35	felt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps a bird may feel in
35	the clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop. My fear
35	grew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth, and again
35	grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave under
35	my desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently. One
35	hand on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavily
35	in attitude to mount again.
35	
35	'But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I
35	looked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote
35	future. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer
35	house, I saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes. They had
35	seen me, and their faces were directed towards me.
35	
35	'Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by
35	the White Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of
35	these emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon
35	which I stood with my machine. He was a slight creature--perhaps
35	four feet high--clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a
35	leather belt. Sandals or buskins--I could not clearly distinguish
35	which--were on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his
35	head was bare. Noticing that, I noticed for the first time how warm
35	the air was.
35	
35	'He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but
35	indescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more
35	beautiful kind of consumptive--that hectic beauty of which we used
35	to hear so much. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence.
35	I took my hands from the machine.
35	
35	
35	
35	
35	IV
35	
35	
35	'In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile
35	thing out of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my
35	eyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at
35	once. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and
35	spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.
35	
35	'There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps
35	eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them
35	addressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was
35	too harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my
35	ears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then
35	touched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my
35	back and shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was
35	nothing in this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in
35	these pretty little people that inspired confidence--a graceful
35	gentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides, they looked so
35	frail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them
35	about like nine-pins. But I made a sudden motion to warn them when I
35	saw their little pink hands feeling at the Time Machine. Happily
35	then, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had hitherto
35	forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed the
35	little levers that would set it in motion, and put these in my
35	pocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in the way of
35	communication.
35	
35	'And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some
35	further peculiarities in their Dresden-china type of prettiness.
35	Their hair, which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the
35	neck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the
35	face, and their ears were singularly minute. The mouths were small,
35	with bright red, rather thin lips, and the little chins ran to a
35	point. The eyes were large and mild; and--this may seem egotism on
35	my part--I fancied even that there was a certain lack of the
35	interest I might have expected in them.
35	
35	'As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood
35	round me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I
35	began the conversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself.
35	Then hesitating for a moment how to express time, I pointed to the
35	sun. At once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and
35	white followed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the
35	sound of thunder.
35	
35	'For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was
35	plain enough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: were
35	these creatures fools? You may hardly understand how it took me.
35	You see I had always anticipated that the people of the year Eight
35	Hundred and Two Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in
35	knowledge, art, everything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a
35	question that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of
35	our five-year-old children--asked me, in fact, if I had come from
35	the sun in a thunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended
35	upon their clothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features.
35	A flow of disappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I felt
35	that I had built the Time Machine in vain.
35	
35	'I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering
35	of a thunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so
35	and bowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of
35	beautiful flowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck.
35	The idea was received with melodious applause; and presently they
35	were all running to and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging
35	them upon me until I was almost smothered with blossom. You who
35	have never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and
35	wonderful flowers countless years of culture had created. Then
35	someone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the
35	nearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx of white marble,
35	which had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my
35	astonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone. As I
35	went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a
35	profoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible
35	merriment, to my mind.
35	
35	'The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal
35	dimensions. I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of
35	little people, and with the big open portals that yawned before me
35	shadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw
35	over their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and
35	flowers, a long neglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number
35	of tall spikes of strange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps
35	across the spread of the waxen petals. They grew scattered, as if
35	wild, among the variegated shrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine
35	them closely at this time. The Time Machine was left deserted on the
35	turf among the rhododendrons.
35	
35	'The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did
35	not observe the carving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw
35	suggestions of old Phoenician decorations as I passed through, and
35	it struck me that they were very badly broken and weather-worn.
35	Several more brightly clad people met me in the doorway, and so we
35	entered, I, dressed in dingy nineteenth-century garments, looking
35	grotesque enough, garlanded with flowers, and surrounded by an
35	eddying mass of bright, soft-colored robes and shining white limbs,
35	in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech.
35	
35	'The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with
35	brown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed
35	with coloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered
35	light. The floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white
35	metal, not plates nor slabs--blocks, and it was so much worn, as I
35	judged by the going to and fro of past generations, as to be deeply
35	channelled along the more frequented ways. Transverse to the length
35	were innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone, raised
35	perhaps a foot from the floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits.
35	Some I recognized as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange,
35	but for the most part they were strange.
35	
35	'Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions.
35	Upon these my conductors seated themselves, signing for me to do
35	likewise. With a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the
35	fruit with their hands, flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into
35	the round openings in the sides of the tables. I was not loath to
35	follow their example, for I felt thirsty and hungry. As I did so I
35	surveyed the hall at my leisure.
35	
35	'And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look.
35	The stained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometrical
35	pattern, were broken in many places, and the curtains that hung
35	across the lower end were thick with dust. And it caught my eye that
35	the corner of the marble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless,
35	the general effect was extremely rich and picturesque. There were,
35	perhaps, a couple of hundred people dining in the hall, and most of
35	them, seated as near to me as they could come, were watching me with
35	interest, their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating.
35	All were clad in the same soft and yet strong, silky material.
35	
35	'Fruit, by the by, was all their diet. These people of the remote
35	future were strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite
35	of some carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I
35	found afterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the
35	Ichthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits were very delightful;
35	one, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time I was
35	there--a floury thing in a three-sided husk--was especially good,
35	and I made it my staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strange
35	fruits, and by the strange flowers I saw, but later I began to
35	perceive their import.
35	
35	'However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future
35	now. So soon as my appetite was a little checked, I determined to
35	make a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of
35	mine. Clearly that was the next thing to do. The fruits seemed a
35	convenient thing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began
35	a series of interrogative sounds and gestures. I had some
35	considerable difficulty in conveying my meaning. At first my efforts
35	met with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter, but
35	presently a fair-haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention
35	and repeated a name. They had to chatter and explain the business
35	at great length to each other, and my first attempts to make the
35	exquisite little sounds of their language caused an immense amount
35	of amusement. However, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children,
35	and persisted, and presently I had a score of noun substantives at
35	least at my command; and then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and
35	even the verb ""to eat."" But it was slow work, and the little people
35	soon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations, so I
35	determined, rather of necessity, to let them give their lessons in
35	little doses when they felt inclined. And very little doses I found
35	they were before long, for I never met people more indolent or more
35	easily fatigued.
35	
35	'A queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that was
35	their lack of interest. They would come to me with eager cries of
35	astonishment, like children, but like children they would soon stop
35	examining me and wander away after some other toy. The dinner and my
35	conversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time that
35	almost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone. It is
35	odd, too, how speedily I came to disregard these little people. I
35	went out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as
35	my hunger was satisfied. I was continually meeting more of these men
35	of the future, who would follow me a little distance, chatter and
35	laugh about me, and, having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly
35	way, leave me again to my own devices.
35	
35	'The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great
35	hall, and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun.
35	At first things were very confusing. Everything was so entirely
35	different from the world I had known--even the flowers. The big
35	building I had left was situated on the slope of a broad river
35	valley, but the Thames had shifted perhaps a mile from its present
35	position. I resolved to mount to the summit of a crest, perhaps a
35	mile and a half away, from which I could get a wider view of this
35	our planet in the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred
35	and One A.D. For that, I should explain, was the date the little
35	dials of my machine recorded.
35	
35	'As I walked I was watching for every impression that could possibly
35	help to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I
35	found the world--for ruinous it was. A little way up the hill, for
35	instance, was a great heap of granite, bound together by masses of
35	aluminium, a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled
35	heaps, amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like
35	plants--nettles possibly--but wonderfully tinted with brown about
35	the leaves, and incapable of stinging. It was evidently the derelict
35	remains of some vast structure, to what end built I could not
35	determine. It was here that I was destined, at a later date, to have
35	a very strange experience--the first intimation of a still stranger
35	discovery--but of that I will speak in its proper place.
35	
35	'Looking round with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I
35	rested for a while, I realized that there were no small houses to be
35	seen. Apparently the single house, and possibly even the household,
35	had vanished. Here and there among the greenery were palace-like
35	buildings, but the house and the cottage, which form such
35	characteristic features of our own English landscape, had
35	disappeared.
35	
35	'""Communism,"" said I to myself.
35	
35	'And on the heels of that came another thought. I looked at the
35	half-dozen little figures that were following me. Then, in a flash,
35	I perceived that all had the same form of costume, the same soft
35	hairless visage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seem
35	strange, perhaps, that I had not noticed this before. But everything
35	was so strange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, and
35	in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the
35	sexes from each other, these people of the future were alike. And
35	the children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their
35	parents. I judged, then, that the children of that time were
35	extremely precocious, physically at least, and I found afterwards
35	abundant verification of my opinion.
35	
35	'Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I
35	felt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what
35	one would expect; for the strength of a man and the softness of a
35	woman, the institution of the family, and the differentiation of
35	occupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical
35	force; where population is balanced and abundant, much childbearing
35	becomes an evil rather than a blessing to the State; where
35	violence comes but rarely and off-spring are secure, there is less
35	necessity--indeed there is no necessity--for an efficient family,
35	and the specialization of the sexes with reference to their
35	children's needs disappears. We see some beginnings of this even
35	in our own time, and in this future age it was complete. This, I
35	must remind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I was to
35	appreciate how far it fell short of the reality.
35	
35	'While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by
35	a pretty little structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in
35	a transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and then
35	resumed the thread of my speculations. There were no large buildings
35	towards the top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidently
35	miraculous, I was presently left alone for the first time. With a
35	strange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest.
35	
35	'There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognize,
35	corroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered
35	in soft moss, the arm-rests cast and filed into the resemblance of
35	griffins' heads. I sat down on it, and I surveyed the broad view of
35	our old world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet and
35	fair a view as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below the
35	horizon and the west was flaming gold, touched with some horizontal
35	bars of purple and crimson. Below was the valley of the Thames, in
35	which the river lay like a band of burnished steel. I have already
35	spoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated
35	greenery, some in ruins and some still occupied. Here and there rose
35	a white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth, here and
35	there came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk. There
35	were no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no evidences of
35	agriculture; the whole earth had become a garden.
35	
35	'So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I had
35	seen, and as it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation
35	was something in this way. (Afterwards I found I had got only a
35	half-truth--or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth.)
35	
35	'It seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane.
35	The ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the
35	first time I began to realize an odd consequence of the social
35	effort in which we are at present engaged. And yet, come to think,
35	it is a logical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need;
35	security sets a premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating the
35	conditions of life--the true civilizing process that makes life more
35	and more secure--had gone steadily on to a climax. One triumph of a
35	united humanity over Nature had followed another. Things that are
35	now mere dreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and
35	carried forward. And the harvest was what I saw!
35	
35	'After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of to-day are still
35	in the rudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked but
35	a little department of the field of human disease, but even so,
35	it spreads its operations very steadily and persistently. Our
35	agriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and
35	cultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the
35	greater number to fight out a balance as they can. We improve our
35	favourite plants and animals--and how few they are--gradually by
35	selective breeding; now a new and better peach, now a seedless
35	grape, now a sweeter and larger flower, now a more convenient breed
35	of cattle. We improve them gradually, because our ideals are vague
35	and tentative, and our knowledge is very limited; because Nature,
35	too, is shy and slow in our clumsy hands. Some day all this will
35	be better organized, and still better. That is the drift of the
35	current in spite of the eddies. The whole world will be intelligent,
35	educated, and co-operating; things will move faster and faster
35	towards the subjugation of Nature. In the end, wisely and carefully
35	we shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suit
35	our human needs.
35	
35	'This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; done
35	indeed for all Time, in the space of Time across which my machine
35	had leaped. The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds or
35	fungi; everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers;
35	brilliant butterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal of
35	preventive medicine was attained. Diseases had been stamped out. I
35	saw no evidence of any contagious diseases during all my stay. And I
35	shall have to tell you later that even the processes of putrefaction
35	and decay had been profoundly affected by these changes.
35	
35	'Social triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed in
35	splendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found them
35	engaged in no toil. There were no signs of struggle, neither social
35	nor economical struggle. The shop, the advertisement, traffic, all
35	that commerce which constitutes the body of our world, was gone. It
35	was natural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of
35	a social paradise. The difficulty of increasing population had been
35	met, I guessed, and population had ceased to increase.
35	
35	'But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to
35	the change. What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is
35	the cause of human intelligence and vigour? Hardship and freedom:
35	conditions under which the active, strong, and subtle survive and
35	the weaker go to the wall; conditions that put a premium upon the
35	loyal alliance of capable men, upon self-restraint, patience, and
35	decision. And the institution of the family, and the emotions that
35	arise therein, the fierce jealousy, the tenderness for offspring,
35	parental self-devotion, all found their justification and support in
35	the imminent dangers of the young. _Now_, where are these imminent
35	dangers? There is a sentiment arising, and it will grow, against
35	connubial jealousy, against fierce maternity, against passion
35	of all sorts; unnecessary things now, and things that make us
35	uncomfortable, savage survivals, discords in a refined and pleasant
35	life.
35	
35	'I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack of
35	intelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my
35	belief in a perfect conquest of Nature. For after the battle comes
35	Quiet. Humanity had been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and had
35	used all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which
35	it lived. And now came the reaction of the altered conditions.
35	
35	'Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, that
35	restless energy, that with us is strength, would become weakness.
35	Even in our own time certain tendencies and desires, once necessary
35	to survival, are a constant source of failure. Physical courage and
35	the love of battle, for instance, are no great help--may even be
35	hindrances--to a civilized man. And in a state of physical balance
35	and security, power, intellectual as well as physical, would be out
35	of place. For countless years I judged there had been no danger of
35	war or solitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting
35	disease to require strength of constitution, no need of toil. For
35	such a life, what we should call the weak are as well equipped as
35	the strong, are indeed no longer weak. Better equipped indeed they
35	are, for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which there
35	was no outlet. No doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw
35	was the outcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy
35	of mankind before it settled down into perfect harmony with the
35	conditions under which it lived--the flourish of that triumph which
35	began the last great peace. This has ever been the fate of energy in
35	security; it takes to art and to eroticism, and then come languor
35	and decay.
35	
35	'Even this artistic impetus would at last die away--had almost died
35	in the Time I saw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to
35	sing in the sunlight: so much was left of the artistic spirit, and
35	no more. Even that would fade in the end into a contented
35	inactivity. We are kept keen on the grindstone of pain and
35	necessity, and, it seemed to me, that here was that hateful
35	grindstone broken at last!
35	
35	'As I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this
35	simple explanation I had mastered the problem of the world--mastered
35	the whole secret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks they
35	had devised for the increase of population had succeeded too well,
35	and their numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary.
35	That would account for the abandoned ruins. Very simple was my
35	explanation, and plausible enough--as most wrong theories are!
35	
35	
35	
35	
35	V
35	
35	
35	'As I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the
35	full moon, yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver
35	light in the north-east. The bright little figures ceased to move
35	about below, a noiseless owl flitted by, and I shivered with the
35	chill of the night. I determined to descend and find where I could
35	sleep.
35	
35	'I looked for the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along to
35	the figure of the White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growing
35	distinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter. I could see
35	the silver birch against it. There was the tangle of rhododendron
35	bushes, black in the pale light, and there was the little lawn.
35	I looked at the lawn again. A queer doubt chilled my complacency.
35	""No,"" said I stoutly to myself, ""that was not the lawn.""
35	
35	'But it _was_ the lawn. For the white leprous face of the sphinx was
35	towards it. Can you imagine what I felt as this conviction came
35	home to me? But you cannot. The Time Machine was gone!
35	
35	'At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of
35	losing my own age, of being left helpless in this strange new world.
35	The bare thought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could
35	feel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing. In another
35	moment I was in a passion of fear and running with great leaping
35	strides down the slope. Once I fell headlong and cut my face; I lost
35	no time in stanching the blood, but jumped up and ran on, with a
35	warm trickle down my cheek and chin. All the time I ran I was saying
35	to myself: ""They have moved it a little, pushed it under the bushes
35	out of the way."" Nevertheless, I ran with all my might. All the
35	time, with the certainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread,
35	I knew that such assurance was folly, knew instinctively that the
35	machine was removed out of my reach. My breath came with pain. I
35	suppose I covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the
35	little lawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am not a young
35	man. I cursed aloud, as I ran, at my confident folly in leaving the
35	machine, wasting good breath thereby. I cried aloud, and none
35	answered. Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit
35	world.
35	
35	'When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realized. Not a trace
35	of the thing was to be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced the
35	empty space among the black tangle of bushes. I ran round it
35	furiously, as if the thing might be hidden in a corner, and then
35	stopped abruptly, with my hands clutching my hair. Above me towered
35	the sphinx, upon the bronze pedestal, white, shining, leprous, in
35	the light of the rising moon. It seemed to smile in mockery of my
35	dismay.
35	
35	'I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put
35	the mechanism in some shelter for me, had I not felt assured of
35	their physical and intellectual inadequacy. That is what dismayed
35	me: the sense of some hitherto unsuspected power, through whose
35	intervention my invention had vanished. Yet, for one thing I felt
35	assured: unless some other age had produced its exact duplicate,
35	the machine could not have moved in time. The attachment of the
35	levers--I will show you the method later--prevented any one from
35	tampering with it in that way when they were removed. It had moved,
35	and was hid, only in space. But then, where could it be?
35	
35	'I think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember running
35	violently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx,
35	and startling some white animal that, in the dim light, I took for a
35	small deer. I remember, too, late that night, beating the bushes
35	with my clenched fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding
35	from the broken twigs. Then, sobbing and raving in my anguish of
35	mind, I went down to the great building of stone. The big hall was
35	dark, silent, and deserted. I slipped on the uneven floor, and fell
35	over one of the malachite tables, almost breaking my shin. I lit a
35	match and went on past the dusty curtains, of which I have told you.
35	
35	'There I found a second great hall covered with cushions, upon
35	which, perhaps, a score or so of the little people were sleeping. I
35	have no doubt they found my second appearance strange enough, coming
35	suddenly out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the
35	splutter and flare of a match. For they had forgotten about matches.
35	""Where is my Time Machine?"" I began, bawling like an angry child,
35	laying hands upon them and shaking them up together. It must have
35	been very queer to them. Some laughed, most of them looked sorely
35	frightened. When I saw them standing round me, it came into my head
35	that I was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do
35	under the circumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear.
35	For, reasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought that fear
35	must be forgotten.
35	
35	'Abruptly, I dashed down the match, and, knocking one of the people
35	over in my course, went blundering across the big dining-hall again,
35	out under the moonlight. I heard cries of terror and their little
35	feet running and stumbling this way and that. I do not remember all
35	I did as the moon crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected
35	nature of my loss that maddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from
35	my own kind--a strange animal in an unknown world. I must have raved
35	to and fro, screaming and crying upon God and Fate. I have a memory
35	of horrible fatigue, as the long night of despair wore away; of
35	looking in this impossible place and that; of groping among moon-lit
35	ruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows; at last,
35	of lying on the ground near the sphinx and weeping with absolute
35	wretchedness. I had nothing left but misery. Then I slept, and when
35	I woke again it was full day, and a couple of sparrows were hopping
35	round me on the turf within reach of my arm.
35	
35	'I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how
35	I had got there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion
35	and despair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain,
35	reasonable daylight, I could look my circumstances fairly in the
35	face. I saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could
35	reason with myself. ""Suppose the worst?"" I said. ""Suppose the
35	machine altogether lost--perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be
35	calm and patient, to learn the way of the people, to get a clear
35	idea of the method of my loss, and the means of getting materials
35	and tools; so that in the end, perhaps, I may make another."" That
35	would be my only hope, perhaps, but better than despair. And, after
35	all, it was a beautiful and curious world.
35	
35	'But probably, the machine had only been taken away. Still, I must
35	be calm and patient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force
35	or cunning. And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about
35	me, wondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, and
35	travel-soiled. The freshness of the morning made me desire an equal
35	freshness. I had exhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went about
35	my business, I found myself wondering at my intense excitement
35	overnight. I made a careful examination of the ground about the
35	little lawn. I wasted some time in futile questionings, conveyed, as
35	well as I was able, to such of the little people as came by. They
35	all failed to understand my gestures; some were simply stolid, some
35	thought it was a jest and laughed at me. I had the hardest task in
35	the world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces. It was
35	a foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger
35	was ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity.
35	The turf gave better counsel. I found a groove ripped in it, about
35	midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet
35	where, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine.
35	There were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow
35	footprints like those I could imagine made by a sloth. This directed
35	my closer attention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have said,
35	of bronze. It was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deep
35	framed panels on either side. I went and rapped at these. The
35	pedestal was hollow. Examining the panels with care I found them
35	discontinuous with the frames. There were no handles or keyholes,
35	but possibly the panels, if they were doors, as I supposed, opened
35	from within. One thing was clear enough to my mind. It took no very
35	great mental effort to infer that my Time Machine was inside that
35	pedestal. But how it got there was a different problem.
35	
35	'I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes
35	and under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned
35	smiling to them and beckoned them to me. They came, and then,
35	pointing to the bronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open
35	it. But at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I
35	don't know how to convey their expression to you. Suppose you were
35	to use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman--it is
35	how she would look. They went off as if they had received the last
35	possible insult. I tried a sweet-looking little chap in white next,
35	with exactly the same result. Somehow, his manner made me feel
35	ashamed of myself. But, as you know, I wanted the Time Machine, and
35	I tried him once more. As he turned off, like the others, my temper
35	got the better of me. In three strides I was after him, had him by
35	the loose part of his robe round the neck, and began dragging him
35	towards the sphinx. Then I saw the horror and repugnance of his
35	face, and all of a sudden I let him go.
35	
35	'But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze
35	panels. I thought I heard something stir inside--to be explicit,
35	I thought I heard a sound like a chuckle--but I must have been
35	mistaken. Then I got a big pebble from the river, and came and
35	hammered till I had flattened a coil in the decorations, and the
35	verdigris came off in powdery flakes. The delicate little people
35	must have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on
35	either hand, but nothing came of it. I saw a crowd of them upon the
35	slopes, looking furtively at me. At last, hot and tired, I sat down
35	to watch the place. But I was too restless to watch long; I am too
35	Occidental for a long vigil. I could work at a problem for years,
35	but to wait inactive for twenty-four hours--that is another matter.
35	
35	'I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the
35	bushes towards the hill again. ""Patience,"" said I to myself. ""If you
35	want your machine again you must leave that sphinx alone. If they
35	mean to take your machine away, it's little good your wrecking their
35	bronze panels, and if they don't, you will get it back as soon as
35	you can ask for it. To sit among all those unknown things before a
35	puzzle like that is hopeless. That way lies monomania. Face this
35	world. Learn its ways, watch it, be careful of too hasty guesses
35	at its meaning. In the end you will find clues to it all."" Then
35	suddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind: the thought
35	of the years I had spent in study and toil to get into the future
35	age, and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it. I had made
35	myself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a
35	man devised. Although it was at my own expense, I could not help
35	myself. I laughed aloud.
35	
35	'Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little
35	people avoided me. It may have been my fancy, or it may have had
35	something to do with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felt
35	tolerably sure of the avoidance. I was careful, however, to show no
35	concern and to abstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course
35	of a day or two things got back to the old footing. I made what
35	progress I could in the language, and in addition I pushed my
35	explorations here and there. Either I missed some subtle point or
35	their language was excessively simple--almost exclusively composed
35	of concrete substantives and verbs. There seemed to be few, if any,
35	abstract terms, or little use of figurative language. Their
35	sentences were usually simple and of two words, and I failed to
35	convey or understand any but the simplest propositions. I determined
35	to put the thought of my Time Machine and the mystery of the bronze
35	doors under the sphinx as much as possible in a corner of memory,
35	until my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a natural
35	way. Yet a certain feeling, you may understand, tethered me in a
35	circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival.
35	
35	'So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant
35	richness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the
35	same abundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material
35	and style, the same clustering thickets of evergreens, the same
35	blossom-laden trees and tree-ferns. Here and there water shone like
35	silver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and
35	so faded into the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which
35	presently attracted my attention, was the presence of certain
35	circular wells, several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth.
35	One lay by the path up the hill, which I had followed during my
35	first walk. Like the others, it was rimmed with bronze, curiously
35	wrought, and protected by a little cupola from the rain. Sitting by
35	the side of these wells, and peering down into the shafted darkness,
35	I could see no gleam of water, nor could I start any reflection
35	with a lighted match. But in all of them I heard a certain sound:
35	a thud--thud--thud, like the beating of some big engine; and I
35	discovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady current of
35	air set down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper into the
35	throat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was at
35	once sucked swiftly out of sight.
35	
35	'After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers
35	standing here and there upon the slopes; for above them there was
35	often just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above
35	a sun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached a strong
35	suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose
35	true import it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined to
35	associate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people. It was an
35	obvious conclusion, but it was absolutely wrong.
35	
35	'And here I must admit that I learned very little of drains and
35	bells and modes of conveyance, and the like conveniences, during my
35	time in this real future. In some of these visions of Utopias and
35	coming times which I have read, there is a vast amount of detail
35	about building, and social arrangements, and so forth. But while
35	such details are easy enough to obtain when the whole world is
35	contained in one's imagination, they are altogether inaccessible to
35	a real traveller amid such realities as I found here. Conceive the
35	tale of London which a negro, fresh from Central Africa, would take
35	back to his tribe! What would he know of railway companies, of
35	social movements, of telephone and telegraph wires, of the Parcels
35	Delivery Company, and postal orders and the like? Yet we, at least,
35	should be willing enough to explain these things to him! And even of
35	what he knew, how much could he make his untravelled friend either
35	apprehend or believe? Then, think how narrow the gap between a negro
35	and a white man of our own times, and how wide the interval between
35	myself and these of the Golden Age! I was sensible of much which was
35	unseen, and which contributed to my comfort; but save for a general
35	impression of automatic organization, I fear I can convey very
35	little of the difference to your mind.
35	
35	'In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of
35	crematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me
35	that, possibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere
35	beyond the range of my explorings. This, again, was a question I
35	deliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirely
35	defeated upon the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was led to make
35	a further remark, which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm
35	among this people there were none.
35	
35	'I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an
35	automatic civilization and a decadent humanity did not long endure.
35	Yet I could think of no other. Let me put my difficulties. The
35	several big palaces I had explored were mere living places, great
35	dining-halls and sleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, no
35	appliances of any kind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasant
35	fabrics that must at times need renewal, and their sandals, though
35	undecorated, were fairly complex specimens of metalwork. Somehow
35	such things must be made. And the little people displayed no vestige
35	of a creative tendency. There were no shops, no workshops, no sign
35	of importations among them. They spent all their time in playing
35	gently, in bathing in the river, in making love in a half-playful
35	fashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I could not see how things
35	were kept going.
35	
35	'Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what,
35	had taken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. Why? For
35	the life of me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, too,
35	those flickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt--how shall
35	I put it? Suppose you found an inscription, with sentences here and
35	there in excellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, others
35	made up of words, of letters even, absolutely unknown to you? Well,
35	on the third day of my visit, that was how the world of Eight
35	Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to
35	me!
35	
35	'That day, too, I made a friend--of a sort. It happened that, as I
35	was watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of
35	them was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The main
35	current ran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate
35	swimmer. It will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange
35	deficiency in these creatures, when I tell you that none made the
35	slightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing which
35	was drowning before their eyes. When I realized this, I hurriedly
35	slipped off my clothes, and, wading in at a point lower down, I
35	caught the poor mite and drew her safe to land. A little rubbing of
35	the limbs soon brought her round, and I had the satisfaction of
35	seeing she was all right before I left her. I had got to such a low
35	estimate of her kind that I did not expect any gratitude from her.
35	In that, however, I was wrong.
35	
35	'This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little
35	woman, as I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centre
35	from an exploration, and she received me with cries of delight and
35	presented me with a big garland of flowers--evidently made for me
35	and me alone. The thing took my imagination. Very possibly I had
35	been feeling desolate. At any rate I did my best to display my
35	appreciation of the gift. We were soon seated together in a little
35	stone arbour, engaged in conversation, chiefly of smiles. The
35	creature's friendliness affected me exactly as a child's might have
35	done. We passed each other flowers, and she kissed my hands. I did
35	the same to hers. Then I tried talk, and found that her name was
35	Weena, which, though I don't know what it meant, somehow seemed
35	appropriate enough. That was the beginning of a queer friendship
35	which lasted a week, and ended--as I will tell you!
35	
35	'She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. She
35	tried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about
35	it went to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last,
35	exhausted and calling after me rather plaintively. But the problems
35	of the world had to be mastered. I had not, I said to myself, come
35	into the future to carry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distress
35	when I left her was very great, her expostulations at the parting
35	were sometimes frantic, and I think, altogether, I had as much
35	trouble as comfort from her devotion. Nevertheless she was, somehow,
35	a very great comfort. I thought it was mere childish affection that
35	made her cling to me. Until it was too late, I did not clearly know
35	what I had inflicted upon her when I left her. Nor until it was too
35	late did I clearly understand what she was to me. For, by merely
35	seeming fond of me, and showing in her weak, futile way that she
35	cared for me, the little doll of a creature presently gave my return
35	to the neighbourhood of the White Sphinx almost the feeling of
35	coming home; and I would watch for her tiny figure of white and gold
35	so soon as I came over the hill.
35	
35	'It was from her, too, that I learned that fear had not yet left the
35	world. She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the
35	oddest confidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I made
35	threatening grimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. But she
35	dreaded the dark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness
35	to her was the one thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate
35	emotion, and it set me thinking and observing. I discovered then,
35	among other things, that these little people gathered into the great
35	houses after dark, and slept in droves. To enter upon them without a
35	light was to put them into a tumult of apprehension. I never found
35	one out of doors, or one sleeping alone within doors, after dark.
35	Yet I was still such a blockhead that I missed the lesson of that
35	fear, and in spite of Weena's distress I insisted upon sleeping away
35	from these slumbering multitudes.
35	
35	'It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me
35	triumphed, and for five of the nights of our acquaintance, including
35	the last night of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm.
35	But my story slips away from me as I speak of her. It must have been
35	the night before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had
35	been restless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and
35	that sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps.
35	I woke with a start, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal
35	had just rushed out of the chamber. I tried to get to sleep again,
35	but I felt restless and uncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour
35	when things are just creeping out of darkness, when everything is
35	colourless and clear cut, and yet unreal. I got up, and went down
35	into the great hall, and so out upon the flagstones in front of the
35	palace. I thought I would make a virtue of necessity, and see the
35	sunrise.
35	
35	'The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor
35	of dawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky
35	black, the ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless.
35	And up the hill I thought I could see ghosts. There several times,
35	as I scanned the slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw
35	a solitary white, ape-like creature running rather quickly up the
35	hill, and once near the ruins I saw a leash of them carrying some
35	dark body. They moved hastily. I did not see what became of them.
35	It seemed that they vanished among the bushes. The dawn was still
35	indistinct, you must understand. I was feeling that chill,
35	uncertain, early-morning feeling you may have known. I doubted
35	my eyes.
35	
35	'As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on
35	and its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned
35	the view keenly. But I saw no vestige of my white figures. They were
35	mere creatures of the half light. ""They must have been ghosts,"" I
35	said; ""I wonder whence they dated."" For a queer notion of Grant
35	Allen's came into my head, and amused me. If each generation die and
35	leave ghosts, he argued, the world at last will get overcrowded with
35	them. On that theory they would have grown innumerable some Eight
35	Hundred Thousand Years hence, and it was no great wonder to see four
35	at once. But the jest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these
35	figures all the morning, until Weena's rescue drove them out of my
35	head. I associated them in some indefinite way with the white animal
35	I had startled in my first passionate search for the Time Machine.
35	But Weena was a pleasant substitute. Yet all the same, they were
35	soon destined to take far deadlier possession of my mind.
35	
35	'I think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather
35	of this Golden Age. I cannot account for it. It may be that the sun
35	was hotter, or the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume that
35	the sun will go on cooling steadily in the future. But people,
35	unfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger Darwin,
35	forget that the planets must ultimately fall back one by one into
35	the parent body. As these catastrophes occur, the sun will blaze
35	with renewed energy; and it may be that some inner planet had
35	suffered this fate. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the
35	sun was very much hotter than we know it.
35	
35	'Well, one very hot morning--my fourth, I think--as I was seeking
35	shelter from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great
35	house where I slept and fed, there happened this strange thing:
35	Clambering among these heaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery,
35	whose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone.
35	By contrast with the brilliancy outside, it seemed at first
35	impenetrably dark to me. I entered it groping, for the change from
35	light to blackness made spots of colour swim before me. Suddenly I
35	halted spellbound. A pair of eyes, luminous by reflection against
35	the daylight without, was watching me out of the darkness.
35	
35	'The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched
35	my hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was
35	afraid to turn. Then the thought of the absolute security in which
35	humanity appeared to be living came to my mind. And then I
35	remembered that strange terror of the dark. Overcoming my fear to
35	some extent, I advanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my
35	voice was harsh and ill-controlled. I put out my hand and touched
35	something soft. At once the eyes darted sideways, and something
35	white ran past me. I turned with my heart in my mouth, and saw a
35	queer little ape-like figure, its head held down in a peculiar
35	manner, running across the sunlit space behind me. It blundered
35	against a block of granite, staggered aside, and in a moment was
35	hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry.
35	
35	'My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a
35	dull white, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that there
35	was flaxen hair on its head and down its back. But, as I say, it
35	went too fast for me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it
35	ran on all-fours, or only with its forearms held very low. After an
35	instant's pause I followed it into the second heap of ruins. I could
35	not find it at first; but, after a time in the profound obscurity, I
35	came upon one of those round well-like openings of which I have told
35	you, half closed by a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me.
35	Could this Thing have vanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and,
35	looking down, I saw a small, white, moving creature, with large
35	bright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated. It made
35	me shudder. It was so like a human spider! It was clambering down
35	the wall, and now I saw for the first time a number of metal foot
35	and hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft. Then the
35	light burned my fingers and fell out of my hand, going out as it
35	dropped, and when I had lit another the little monster had
35	disappeared.
35	
35	'I do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not for
35	some time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I
35	had seen was human. But, gradually, the truth dawned on me: that
35	Man had not remained one species, but had differentiated into two
35	distinct animals: that my graceful children of the Upper-world were
35	not the sole descendants of our generation, but that this bleached,
35	obscene, nocturnal Thing, which had flashed before me, was also heir
35	to all the ages.
35	
35	'I thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an
35	underground ventilation. I began to suspect their true import. And
35	what, I wondered, was this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly
35	balanced organization? How was it related to the indolent serenity
35	of the beautiful Upper-worlders? And what was hidden down there,
35	at the foot of that shaft? I sat upon the edge of the well telling
35	myself that, at any rate, there was nothing to fear, and that there
35	I must descend for the solution of my difficulties. And withal I
35	was absolutely afraid to go! As I hesitated, two of the beautiful
35	Upper-world people came running in their amorous sport across the
35	daylight in the shadow. The male pursued the female, flinging
35	flowers at her as he ran.
35	
35	'They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned
35	pillar, peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad form
35	to remark these apertures; for when I pointed to this one, and tried
35	to frame a question about it in their tongue, they were still more
35	visibly distressed and turned away. But they were interested by my
35	matches, and I struck some to amuse them. I tried them again about
35	the well, and again I failed. So presently I left them, meaning to
35	go back to Weena, and see what I could get from her. But my mind was
35	already in revolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping and
35	sliding to a new adjustment. I had now a clue to the import of these
35	wells, to the ventilating towers, to the mystery of the ghosts; to
35	say nothing of a hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the
35	fate of the Time Machine! And very vaguely there came a suggestion
35	towards the solution of the economic problem that had puzzled me.
35	
35	'Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was
35	subterranean. There were three circumstances in particular which
35	made me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome
35	of a long-continued underground habit. In the first place, there was
35	the bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the
35	dark--the white fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then,
35	those large eyes, with that capacity for reflecting light, are
35	common features of nocturnal things--witness the owl and the cat.
35	And last of all, that evident confusion in the sunshine, that hasty
35	yet fumbling awkward flight towards dark shadow, and that peculiar
35	carriage of the head while in the light--all reinforced the theory
35	of an extreme sensitiveness of the retina.
35	
35	'Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, and
35	these tunnellings were the habitat of the new race. The presence of
35	ventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes--everywhere, in
35	fact, except along the river valley--showed how universal were its
35	ramifications. What so natural, then, as to assume that it was in
35	this artificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the
35	comfort of the daylight race was done? The notion was so plausible
35	that I at once accepted it, and went on to assume the _how_ of this
35	splitting of the human species. I dare say you will anticipate the
35	shape of my theory; though, for myself, I very soon felt that it
35	fell far short of the truth.
35	
35	'At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed
35	clear as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present
35	merely temporary and social difference between the Capitalist and
35	the Labourer, was the key to the whole position. No doubt it will
35	seem grotesque enough to you--and wildly incredible!--and yet even
35	now there are existing circumstances to point that way. There is
35	a tendency to utilize underground space for the less ornamental
35	purposes of civilization; there is the Metropolitan Railway in
35	London, for instance, there are new electric railways, there are
35	subways, there are underground workrooms and restaurants, and they
35	increase and multiply. Evidently, I thought, this tendency had
35	increased till Industry had gradually lost its birthright in the
35	sky. I mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and ever
35	larger underground factories, spending a still-increasing amount of
35	its time therein, till, in the end--! Even now, does not an East-end
35	worker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut
35	off from the natural surface of the earth?
35	
35	'Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people--due, no doubt, to
35	the increasing refinement of their education, and the widening gulf
35	between them and the rude violence of the poor--is already leading
35	to the closing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the
35	surface of the land. About London, for instance, perhaps half the
35	prettier country is shut in against intrusion. And this same
35	widening gulf--which is due to the length and expense of the higher
35	educational process and the increased facilities for and temptations
35	towards refined habits on the part of the rich--will make that
35	exchange between class and class, that promotion by intermarriage
35	which at present retards the splitting of our species along lines
35	of social stratification, less and less frequent. So, in the end,
35	above ground you must have the Haves, pursuing pleasure and comfort
35	and beauty, and below ground the Have-nots, the Workers getting
35	continually adapted to the conditions of their labour. Once they
35	were there, they would no doubt have to pay rent, and not a little
35	of it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and if they refused,
35	they would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such of them as were
35	so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die; and, in
35	the end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would become as
35	well adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as happy in
35	their way, as the Upper-world people were to theirs. As it seemed to
35	me, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed naturally
35	enough.
35	
35	'The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different
35	shape in my mind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and
35	general co-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a real
35	aristocracy, armed with a perfected science and working to a logical
35	conclusion the industrial system of to-day. Its triumph had not been
35	simply a triumph over Nature, but a triumph over Nature and the
35	fellow-man. This, I must warn you, was my theory at the time. I had
35	no convenient cicerone in the pattern of the Utopian books. My
35	explanation may be absolutely wrong. I still think it is the
35	most plausible one. But even on this supposition the balanced
35	civilization that was at last attained must have long since passed
35	its zenith, and was now far fallen into decay. The too-perfect
35	security of the Upper-worlders had led them to a slow movement of
35	degeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, and
35	intelligence. That I could see clearly enough already. What had
35	happened to the Under-grounders I did not yet suspect; but from what
35	I had seen of the Morlocks--that, by the by, was the name by which
35	these creatures were called--I could imagine that the modification
35	of the human type was even far more profound than among the ""Eloi,""
35	the beautiful race that I already knew.
35	
35	'Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time
35	Machine? For I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if
35	the Eloi were masters, could they not restore the machine to me? And
35	why were they so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I have
35	said, to question Weena about this Under-world, but here again I was
35	disappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, and
35	presently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though the
35	topic was unendurable. And when I pressed her, perhaps a little
35	harshly, she burst into tears. They were the only tears, except my
35	own, I ever saw in that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased
35	abruptly to trouble about the Morlocks, and was only concerned in
35	banishing these signs of the human inheritance from Weena's eyes.
35	And very soon she was smiling and clapping her hands, while I
35	solemnly burned a match.
35	
35	
35	
35	
35	VI
35	
35	
35	'It may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow
35	up the new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt
35	a peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the
35	half-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in
35	spirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to the
35	touch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic
35	influence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began
35	to appreciate.
35	
35	'The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a
35	little disordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once
35	or twice I had a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive
35	no definite reason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the great
35	hall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight--that
35	night Weena was among them--and feeling reassured by their presence.
35	It occurred to me even then, that in the course of a few days the
35	moon must pass through its last quarter, and the nights grow dark,
35	when the appearances of these unpleasant creatures from below, these
35	whitened Lemurs, this new vermin that had replaced the old, might be
35	more abundant. And on both these days I had the restless feeling of
35	one who shirks an inevitable duty. I felt assured that the Time
35	Machine was only to be recovered by boldly penetrating these
35	underground mysteries. Yet I could not face the mystery. If only I
35	had had a companion it would have been different. But I was so
35	horribly alone, and even to clamber down into the darkness of the
35	well appalled me. I don't know if you will understand my feeling,
35	but I never felt quite safe at my back.
35	
35	'It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me
35	further and further afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the
35	south-westward towards the rising country that is now called Combe
35	Wood, I observed far off, in the direction of nineteenth-century
35	Banstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any
35	I had hitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palaces
35	or ruins I knew, and the facade had an Oriental look: the face
35	of it having the lustre, as well as the pale-green tint, a kind
35	of bluish-green, of a certain type of Chinese porcelain. This
35	difference in aspect suggested a difference in use, and I was minded
35	to push on and explore. But the day was growing late, and I had come
35	upon the sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit; so I
35	resolved to hold over the adventure for the following day, and I
35	returned to the welcome and the caresses of little Weena. But next
35	morning I perceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding the
35	Palace of Green Porcelain was a piece of self-deception, to enable
35	me to shirk, by another day, an experience I dreaded. I resolved I
35	would make the descent without further waste of time, and started
35	out in the early morning towards a well near the ruins of granite
35	and aluminium.
35	
35	'Little Weena ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, but
35	when she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed
35	strangely disconcerted. ""Good-bye, little Weena,"" I said, kissing
35	her; and then putting her down, I began to feel over the parapet
35	for the climbing hooks. Rather hastily, I may as well confess, for
35	I feared my courage might leak away! At first she watched me in
35	amazement. Then she gave a most piteous cry, and running to me, she
35	began to pull at me with her little hands. I think her opposition
35	nerved me rather to proceed. I shook her off, perhaps a little
35	roughly, and in another moment I was in the throat of the well. I
35	saw her agonized face over the parapet, and smiled to reassure her.
35	Then I had to look down at the unstable hooks to which I clung.
35	
35	'I had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The
35	descent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from
35	the sides of the well, and these being adapted to the needs of
35	a creature much smaller and lighter than myself, I was speedily
35	cramped and fatigued by the descent. And not simply fatigued! One of
35	the bars bent suddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off into
35	the blackness beneath. For a moment I hung by one hand, and after
35	that experience I did not dare to rest again. Though my arms and
35	back were presently acutely painful, I went on clambering down the
35	sheer descent with as quick a motion as possible. Glancing upward,
35	I saw the aperture, a small blue disk, in which a star was visible,
35	while little Weena's head showed as a round black projection. The
35	thudding sound of a machine below grew louder and more oppressive.
35	Everything save that little disk above was profoundly dark, and when
35	I looked up again Weena had disappeared.
35	
35	'I was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to go
35	up the shaft again, and leave the Under-world alone. But even while
35	I turned this over in my mind I continued to descend. At last, with
35	intense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, a
35	slender loophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the
35	aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down and
35	rest. It was not too soon. My arms ached, my back was cramped, and I
35	was trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the
35	unbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes. The air
35	was full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the
35	shaft.
35	
35	'I do not know how long I lay. I was roused by a soft hand touching
35	my face. Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and,
35	hastily striking one, I saw three stooping white creatures similar
35	to the one I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating
35	before the light. Living, as they did, in what appeared to me
35	impenetrable darkness, their eyes were abnormally large and
35	sensitive, just as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes, and they
35	reflected the light in the same way. I have no doubt they could see
35	me in that rayless obscurity, and they did not seem to have any fear
35	of me apart from the light. But, so soon as I struck a match in
35	order to see them, they fled incontinently, vanishing into dark
35	gutters and tunnels, from which their eyes glared at me in the
35	strangest fashion.
35	
35	'I tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently
35	different from that of the Over-world people; so that I was needs
35	left to my own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight before
35	exploration was even then in my mind. But I said to myself, ""You are
35	in for it now,"" and, feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the
35	noise of machinery grow louder. Presently the walls fell away from
35	me, and I came to a large open space, and striking another match,
35	saw that I had entered a vast arched cavern, which stretched into
35	utter darkness beyond the range of my light. The view I had of it
35	was as much as one could see in the burning of a match.
35	
35	'Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines rose
35	out of the dimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim
35	spectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare. The place, by the by,
35	was very stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly
35	shed blood was in the air. Some way down the central vista was a
35	little table of white metal, laid with what seemed a meal. The
35	Morlocks at any rate were carnivorous! Even at the time, I remember
35	wondering what large animal could have survived to furnish the red
35	joint I saw. It was all very indistinct: the heavy smell, the big
35	unmeaning shapes, the obscene figures lurking in the shadows, and
35	only waiting for the darkness to come at me again! Then the match
35	burned down, and stung my fingers, and fell, a wriggling red spot
35	in the blackness.
35	
35	'I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such
35	an experience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I had
35	started with the absurd assumption that the men of the Future would
35	certainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances.
35	I had come without arms, without medicine, without anything to
35	smoke--at times I missed tobacco frightfully--even without enough
35	matches. If only I had thought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that
35	glimpse of the Underworld in a second, and examined it at leisure.
35	But, as it was, I stood there with only the weapons and the powers
35	that Nature had endowed me with--hands, feet, and teeth; these, and
35	four safety-matches that still remained to me.
35	
35	'I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the
35	dark, and it was only with my last glimpse of light I discovered
35	that my store of matches had run low. It had never occurred to me
35	until that moment that there was any need to economize them, and I
35	had wasted almost half the box in astonishing the Upper-worlders, to
35	whom fire was a novelty. Now, as I say, I had four left, and while I
35	stood in the dark, a hand touched mine, lank fingers came feeling
35	over my face, and I was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour. I
35	fancied I heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little
35	beings about me. I felt the box of matches in my hand being gently
35	disengaged, and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing. The
35	sense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescribably
35	unpleasant. The sudden realization of my ignorance of their ways of
35	thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness. I
35	shouted at them as loudly as I could. They started away, and then
35	I could feel them approaching me again. They clutched at me more
35	boldly, whispering odd sounds to each other. I shivered violently,
35	and shouted again--rather discordantly. This time they were not so
35	seriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing noise as they came
35	back at me. I will confess I was horribly frightened. I determined
35	to strike another match and escape under the protection of its
35	glare. I did so, and eking out the flicker with a scrap of paper
35	from my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel. But I
35	had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the
35	blackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among leaves,
35	and pattering like the rain, as they hurried after me.
35	
35	'In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no
35	mistaking that they were trying to haul me back. I struck another
35	light, and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imagine
35	how nauseatingly inhuman they looked--those pale, chinless faces
35	and great, lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!--as they stared in their
35	blindness and bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise
35	you: I retreated again, and when my second match had ended, I struck
35	my third. It had almost burned through when I reached the opening
35	into the shaft. I lay down on the edge, for the throb of the great
35	pump below made me giddy. Then I felt sideways for the projecting
35	hooks, and, as I did so, my feet were grasped from behind, and I
35	was violently tugged backward. I lit my last match ... and it
35	incontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing bars now,
35	and, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from the clutches of the
35	Morlocks and was speedily clambering up the shaft, while they stayed
35	peering and blinking up at me: all but one little wretch who
35	followed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a trophy.
35	
35	'That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or
35	thirty feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest
35	difficulty in keeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightful
35	struggle against this faintness. Several times my head swam, and I
35	felt all the sensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the
35	well-mouth somehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding
35	sunlight. I fell upon my face. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean.
35	Then I remember Weena kissing my hands and ears, and the voices of
35	others among the Eloi. Then, for a time, I was insensible.
35	
35	
35	
35	
35	VII
35	
35	
35	'Now, indeed, I seemed in a worse case than before. Hitherto,
35	except during my night's anguish at the loss of the Time Machine,
35	I had felt a sustaining hope of ultimate escape, but that hope was
35	staggered by these new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thought
35	myself impeded by the childish simplicity of the little people, and
35	by some unknown forces which I had only to understand to overcome;
35	but there was an altogether new element in the sickening quality of
35	the Morlocks--a something inhuman and malign. Instinctively I
35	loathed them. Before, I had felt as a man might feel who had fallen
35	into a pit: my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it.
35	Now I felt like a beast in a trap, whose enemy would come upon him
35	soon.
35	
35	'The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the
35	new moon. Weena had put this into my head by some at first
35	incomprehensible remarks about the Dark Nights. It was not now
35	such a very difficult problem to guess what the coming Dark Nights
35	might mean. The moon was on the wane: each night there was a longer
35	interval of darkness. And I now understood to some slight degree at
35	least the reason of the fear of the little Upper-world people for
35	the dark. I wondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be that
35	the Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt pretty sure now that
35	my second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upper-world people might
35	once have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks their
35	mechanical servants: but that had long since passed away. The two
35	species that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding
35	down towards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new
35	relationship. The Eloi, like the Carolingian kings, had decayed
35	to a mere beautiful futility. They still possessed the earth on
35	sufferance: since the Morlocks, subterranean for innumerable
35	generations, had come at last to find the daylit surface
35	intolerable. And the Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, and
35	maintained them in their habitual needs, perhaps through the
35	survival of an old habit of service. They did it as a standing horse
35	paws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport:
35	because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the
35	organism. But, clearly, the old order was already in part reversed.
35	The Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace. Ages ago,
35	thousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of
35	the ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coming back
35	changed! Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew.
35	They were becoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly there came
35	into my head the memory of the meat I had seen in the Under-world.
35	It seemed odd how it floated into my mind: not stirred up as it
35	were by the current of my meditations, but coming in almost like a
35	question from outside. I tried to recall the form of it. I had a
35	vague sense of something familiar, but I could not tell what it was
35	at the time.
35	
35	'Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of their
35	mysterious Fear, I was differently constituted. I came out of this
35	age of ours, this ripe prime of the human race, when Fear does not
35	paralyse and mystery has lost its terrors. I at least would defend
35	myself. Without further delay I determined to make myself arms and a
35	fastness where I might sleep. With that refuge as a base, I could
35	face this strange world with some of that confidence I had lost in
35	realizing to what creatures night by night I lay exposed. I felt
35	I could never sleep again until my bed was secure from them. I
35	shuddered with horror to think how they must already have examined
35	me.
35	
35	'I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but
35	found nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. All
35	the buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous
35	climbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be. Then the
35	tall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished
35	gleam of its walls came back to my memory; and in the evening,
35	taking Weena like a child upon my shoulder, I went up the hills
35	towards the south-west. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven or
35	eight miles, but it must have been nearer eighteen. I had first seen
35	the place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptively
35	diminished. In addition, the heel of one of my shoes was loose, and
35	a nail was working through the sole--they were comfortable old shoes
35	I wore about indoors--so that I was lame. And it was already long
35	past sunset when I came in sight of the palace, silhouetted black
35	against the pale yellow of the sky.
35	
35	'Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but
35	after a while she desired me to let her down, and ran along by the
35	side of me, occasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers
35	to stick in my pockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at
35	the last she had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vase
35	for floral decoration. At least she utilized them for that purpose.
35	And that reminds me! In changing my jacket I found...'
35	
35	The Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and
35	silently placed two withered flowers, not unlike very large white
35	mallows, upon the little table. Then he resumed his narrative.
35	
35	'As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over
35	the hill crest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to
35	return to the house of grey stone. But I pointed out the distant
35	pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to
35	make her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from her
35	Fear. You know that great pause that comes upon things before the
35	dusk? Even the breeze stops in the trees. To me there is always an
35	air of expectation about that evening stillness. The sky was clear,
35	remote, and empty save for a few horizontal bars far down in the
35	sunset. Well, that night the expectation took the colour of my
35	fears. In that darkling calm my senses seemed preternaturally
35	sharpened. I fancied I could even feel the hollowness of the ground
35	beneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see through it the Morlocks
35	on their ant-hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark.
35	In my excitement I fancied that they would receive my invasion of
35	their burrows as a declaration of war. And why had they taken my
35	Time Machine?
35	
35	'So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night.
35	The clear blue of the distance faded, and one star after another
35	came out. The ground grew dim and the trees black. Weena's fears and
35	her fatigue grew upon her. I took her in my arms and talked to her
35	and caressed her. Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her
35	arms round my neck, and, closing her eyes, tightly pressed her face
35	against my shoulder. So we went down a long slope into a valley, and
35	there in the dimness I almost walked into a little river. This I
35	waded, and went up the opposite side of the valley, past a number
35	of sleeping houses, and by a statue--a Faun, or some such figure,
35	_minus_ the head. Here too were acacias. So far I had seen nothing of
35	the Morlocks, but it was yet early in the night, and the darker hours
35	before the old moon rose were still to come.
35	
35	'From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide
35	and black before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to
35	it, either to the right or the left. Feeling tired--my feet, in
35	particular, were very sore--I carefully lowered Weena from my
35	shoulder as I halted, and sat down upon the turf. I could no
35	longer see the Palace of Green Porcelain, and I was in doubt of my
35	direction. I looked into the thickness of the wood and thought of
35	what it might hide. Under that dense tangle of branches one would
35	be out of sight of the stars. Even were there no other lurking
35	danger--a danger I did not care to let my imagination loose
35	upon--there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the
35	tree-boles to strike against.
35	
35	'I was very tired, too, after the excitements of the day; so I
35	decided that I would not face it, but would pass the night upon the
35	open hill.
35	
35	'Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her
35	in my jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The
35	hill-side was quiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood
35	there came now and then a stir of living things. Above me shone the
35	stars, for the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense of
35	friendly comfort in their twinkling. All the old constellations
35	had gone from the sky, however: that slow movement which is
35	imperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes, had long since
35	rearranged them in unfamiliar groupings. But the Milky Way, it
35	seemed to me, was still the same tattered streamer of star-dust as
35	of yore. Southward (as I judged it) was a very bright red star that
35	was new to me; it was even more splendid than our own green Sirius.
35	And amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planet
35	shone kindly and steadily like the face of an old friend.
35	
35	'Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all
35	the gravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable
35	distance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of
35	the unknown past into the unknown future. I thought of the great
35	precessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only forty
35	times had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that
35	I had traversed. And during these few revolutions all the activity,
35	all the traditions, the complex organizations, the nations,
35	languages, literatures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man as
35	I knew him, had been swept out of existence. Instead were these
35	frail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry, and the white
35	Things of which I went in terror. Then I thought of the Great Fear
35	that was between the two species, and for the first time, with a
35	sudden shiver, came the clear knowledge of what the meat I had seen
35	might be. Yet it was too horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping
35	beside me, her face white and starlike under the stars, and
35	forthwith dismissed the thought.
35	
35	'Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as
35	I could, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find
35	signs of the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky kept
35	very clear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at
35	times. Then, as my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward
35	sky, like the reflection of some colourless fire, and the old moon
35	rose, thin and peaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking
35	it, and overflowing it, the dawn came, pale at first, and then
35	growing pink and warm. No Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had
35	seen none upon the hill that night. And in the confidence of renewed
35	day it almost seemed to me that my fear had been unreasonable. I
35	stood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollen at the ankle
35	and painful under the heel; so I sat down again, took off my shoes,
35	and flung them away.
35	
35	'I awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood, now green and
35	pleasant instead of black and forbidding. We found some fruit
35	wherewith to break our fast. We soon met others of the dainty ones,
35	laughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such
35	thing in nature as the night. And then I thought once more of the
35	meat that I had seen. I felt assured now of what it was, and from
35	the bottom of my heart I pitied this last feeble rill from the great
35	flood of humanity. Clearly, at some time in the Long-Ago of human
35	decay the Morlocks' food had run short. Possibly they had lived on
35	rats and such-like vermin. Even now man is far less discriminating
35	and exclusive in his food than he was--far less than any monkey. His
35	prejudice against human flesh is no deep-seated instinct. And so
35	these inhuman sons of men----! I tried to look at the thing in a
35	scientific spirit. After all, they were less human and more remote
35	than our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago.
35	And the intelligence that would have made this state of things a
35	torment had gone. Why should I trouble myself? These Eloi were mere
35	fatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and preyed
35	upon--probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Weena dancing
35	at my side!
35	
35	'Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming
35	upon me, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human
35	selfishness. Man had been content to live in ease and delight upon
35	the labours of his fellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword
35	and excuse, and in the fullness of time Necessity had come home to
35	him. I even tried a Carlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy
35	in decay. But this attitude of mind was impossible. However great
35	their intellectual degradation, the Eloi had kept too much of the
35	human form not to claim my sympathy, and to make me perforce a
35	sharer in their degradation and their Fear.
35	
35	'I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should
35	pursue. My first was to secure some safe place of refuge, and to
35	make myself such arms of metal or stone as I could contrive. That
35	necessity was immediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure some
35	means of fire, so that I should have the weapon of a torch at hand,
35	for nothing, I knew, would be more efficient against these Morlocks.
35	Then I wanted to arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of
35	bronze under the White Sphinx. I had in mind a battering ram. I had
35	a persuasion that if I could enter those doors and carry a blaze of
35	light before me I should discover the Time Machine and escape. I
35	could not imagine the Morlocks were strong enough to move it far
35	away. Weena I had resolved to bring with me to our own time. And
35	turning such schemes over in my mind I pursued our way towards the
35	building which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling.
35	
35	
35	
35	
35	VIII
35	
35	
35	'I found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about
35	noon, deserted and falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass
35	remained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had
35	fallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high
35	upon a turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I
35	was surprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged
35	Wandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then--though
35	I never followed up the thought--of what might have happened, or
35	might be happening, to the living things in the sea.
35	
35	'The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed
35	porcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in some
35	unknown character. I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena might
35	help me to interpret this, but I only learned that the bare idea of
35	writing had never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I
35	fancy, more human than she was, perhaps because her affection was so
35	human.
35	
35	'Within the big valves of the door--which were open and broken--we
35	found, instead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many
35	side windows. At the first glance I was reminded of a museum.
35	The tiled floor was thick with dust, and a remarkable array of
35	miscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same grey covering. Then
35	I perceived, standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall,
35	what was clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton. I recognized
35	by the oblique feet that it was some extinct creature after the
35	fashion of the Megatherium. The skull and the upper bones lay
35	beside it in the thick dust, and in one place, where rain-water had
35	dropped through a leak in the roof, the thing itself had been worn
35	away. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton barrel of a
35	Brontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going towards the
35	side I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and clearing away
35	the thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of our own
35	time. But they must have been air-tight to judge from the fair
35	preservation of some of their contents.
35	
35	'Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South
35	Kensington! Here, apparently, was the Palaeontological Section,
35	and a very splendid array of fossils it must have been, though the
35	inevitable process of decay that had been staved off for a time, and
35	had, through the extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine
35	hundredths of its force, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if
35	with extreme slowness at work again upon all its treasures. Here and
35	there I found traces of the little people in the shape of rare
35	fossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds. And the
35	cases had in some instances been bodily removed--by the Morlocks as
35	I judged. The place was very silent. The thick dust deadened our
35	footsteps. Weena, who had been rolling a sea urchin down the sloping
35	glass of a case, presently came, as I stared about me, and very
35	quietly took my hand and stood beside me.
35	
35	'And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an
35	intellectual age, that I gave no thought to the possibilities it
35	presented. Even my preoccupation about the Time Machine receded a
35	little from my mind.
35	
35	'To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain
35	had a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palaeontology;
35	possibly historical galleries; it might be, even a library! To me,
35	at least in my present circumstances, these would be vastly more
35	interesting than this spectacle of oldtime geology in decay.
35	Exploring, I found another short gallery running transversely to the
35	first. This appeared to be devoted to minerals, and the sight of a
35	block of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder. But I could find
35	no saltpeter; indeed, no nitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had
35	deliquesced ages ago. Yet the sulphur hung in my mind, and set up a
35	train of thinking. As for the rest of the contents of that gallery,
35	though on the whole they were the best preserved of all I saw, I had
35	little interest. I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I went on
35	down a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall I had
35	entered. Apparently this section had been devoted to natural
35	history, but everything had long since passed out of recognition. A
35	few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once been stuffed
35	animals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held spirit, a
35	brown dust of departed plants: that was all! I was sorry for that,
35	because I should have been glad to trace the patent readjustments by
35	which the conquest of animated nature had been attained. Then we
35	came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but singularly
35	ill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the
35	end at which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from the
35	ceiling--many of them cracked and smashed--which suggested that
35	originally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in
35	my element, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of
35	big machines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some
35	still fairly complete. You know I have a certain weakness for
35	mechanism, and I was inclined to linger among these; the more so as
35	for the most part they had the interest of puzzles, and I could make
35	only the vaguest guesses at what they were for. I fancied that if
35	I could solve their puzzles I should find myself in possession of
35	powers that might be of use against the Morlocks.
35	
35	'Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she
35	startled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should have
35	noticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: It
35	may be, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum
35	was built into the side of a hill.--ED.] The end I had come in at
35	was quite above ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As
35	you went down the length, the ground came up against these windows,
35	until at last there was a pit like the ""area"" of a London house
35	before each, and only a narrow line of daylight at the top. I went
35	slowly along, puzzling about the machines, and had been too intent
35	upon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light, until
35	Weena's increasing apprehensions drew my attention. Then I saw that
35	the gallery ran down at last into a thick darkness. I hesitated, and
35	then, as I looked round me, I saw that the dust was less abundant
35	and its surface less even. Further away towards the dimness, it
35	appeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints. My
35	sense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks revived at that.
35	I felt that I was wasting my time in the academic examination of
35	machinery. I called to mind that it was already far advanced in the
35	afternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means
35	of making a fire. And then down in the remote blackness of the
35	gallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I had
35	heard down the well.
35	
35	'I took Weena's hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, I left her
35	and turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike
35	those in a signal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this
35	lever in my hands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly
35	Weena, deserted in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged
35	the strength of the lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a
35	minute's strain, and I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than
35	sufficient, I judged, for any Morlock skull I might encounter. And I
35	longed very much to kill a Morlock or so. Very inhuman, you may
35	think, to want to go killing one's own descendants! But it was
35	impossible, somehow, to feel any humanity in the things. Only my
35	disinclination to leave Weena, and a persuasion that if I began to
35	slake my thirst for murder my Time Machine might suffer, restrained
35	me from going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes I
35	heard.
35	
35	'Well, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of that
35	gallery and into another and still larger one, which at the first
35	glance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags.
35	The brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I
35	presently recognized as the decaying vestiges of books. They had
35	long since dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had left
35	them. But here and there were warped boards and cracked metallic
35	clasps that told the tale well enough. Had I been a literary man I
35	might, perhaps, have moralized upon the futility of all ambition.
35	But as it was, the thing that struck me with keenest force was the
35	enormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rotting
35	paper testified. At the time I will confess that I thought chiefly
35	of the _Philosophical Transactions_ and my own seventeen papers upon
35	physical optics.
35	
35	'Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have
35	been a gallery of technical chemistry. And here I had not a little
35	hope of useful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof had
35	collapsed, this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every
35	unbroken case. And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases,
35	I found a box of matches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were
35	perfectly good. They were not even damp. I turned to Weena. ""Dance,""
35	I cried to her in her own tongue. For now I had a weapon indeed
35	against the horrible creatures we feared. And so, in that derelict
35	museum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to Weena's huge
35	delight, I solemnly performed a kind of composite dance, whistling
35	_The Land of the Leal_ as cheerfully as I could. In part it was a
35	modest _cancan_, in part a step dance, in part a skirt-dance (so far
35	as my tail-coat permitted), and in part original. For I am naturally
35	inventive, as you know.
35	
35	'Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped
35	the wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange, as for
35	me it was a most fortunate thing. Yet, oddly enough, I found a far
35	unlikelier substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed
35	jar, that by chance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed.
35	I fancied at first that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass
35	accordingly. But the odour of camphor was unmistakable. In the
35	universal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive,
35	perhaps through many thousands of centuries. It reminded me of a
35	sepia painting I had once seen done from the ink of a fossil
35	Belemnite that must have perished and become fossilized millions
35	of years ago. I was about to throw it away, but I remembered that
35	it was inflammable and burned with a good bright flame--was, in
35	fact, an excellent candle--and I put it in my pocket. I found no
35	explosives, however, nor any means of breaking down the bronze
35	doors. As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I had
35	chanced upon. Nevertheless I left that gallery greatly elated.
35	
35	'I cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It would
35	require a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all
35	the proper order. I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of
35	arms, and how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a
35	sword. I could not carry both, however, and my bar of iron promised
35	best against the bronze gates. There were numbers of guns, pistols,
35	and rifles. The most were masses of rust, but many were of some
35	new metal, and still fairly sound. But any cartridges or powder
35	there may once have been had rotted into dust. One corner I saw was
35	charred and shattered; perhaps, I thought, by an explosion among the
35	specimens. In another place was a vast array of idols--Polynesian,
35	Mexican, Grecian, Phoenician, every country on earth I should think.
35	And here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I wrote my name upon
35	the nose of a steatite monster from South America that particularly
35	took my fancy.
35	
35	'As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery
35	after gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes
35	mere heaps of rust and lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place I
35	suddenly found myself near the model of a tin-mine, and then by the
35	merest accident I discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamite
35	cartridges! I shouted ""Eureka!"" and smashed the case with joy. Then
35	came a doubt. I hesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery,
35	I made my essay. I never felt such a disappointment as I did in
35	waiting five, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came.
35	Of course the things were dummies, as I might have guessed from
35	their presence. I really believe that had they not been so, I should
35	have rushed off incontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze doors, and
35	(as it proved) my chances of finding the Time Machine, all together
35	into non-existence.
35	
35	'It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court
35	within the palace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we
35	rested and refreshed ourselves. Towards sunset I began to consider
35	our position. Night was creeping upon us, and my inaccessible
35	hiding-place had still to be found. But that troubled me very little
35	now. I had in my possession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of
35	all defences against the Morlocks--I had matches! I had the camphor
35	in my pocket, too, if a blaze were needed. It seemed to me that
35	the best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open,
35	protected by a fire. In the morning there was the getting of the
35	Time Machine. Towards that, as yet, I had only my iron mace. But
35	now, with my growing knowledge, I felt very differently towards
35	those bronze doors. Up to this, I had refrained from forcing them,
35	largely because of the mystery on the other side. They had never
35	impressed me as being very strong, and I hoped to find my bar of
35	iron not altogether inadequate for the work.
35	
35	
35	
35	
35	IX
35	
35	
35	'We emerged from the palace while the sun was still in part above
35	the horizon. I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the
35	next morning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods
35	that had stopped me on the previous journey. My plan was to go as
35	far as possible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep
35	in the protection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I
35	gathered any sticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my arms
35	full of such litter. Thus loaded, our progress was slower than I had
35	anticipated, and besides Weena was tired. And I began to suffer from
35	sleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the
35	wood. Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped,
35	fearing the darkness before us; but a singular sense of impending
35	calamity, that should indeed have served me as a warning, drove me
35	onward. I had been without sleep for a night and two days, and I was
35	feverish and irritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the
35	Morlocks with it.
35	
35	'While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim
35	against their blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was
35	scrub and long grass all about us, and I did not feel safe from
35	their insidious approach. The forest, I calculated, was rather
35	less than a mile across. If we could get through it to the bare
35	hill-side, there, as it seemed to me, was an altogether safer
35	resting-place; I thought that with my matches and my camphor I could
35	contrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods. Yet it was
35	evident that if I was to flourish matches with my hands I should
35	have to abandon my firewood; so, rather reluctantly, I put it down.
35	And then it came into my head that I would amaze our friends behind
35	by lighting it. I was to discover the atrocious folly of this
35	proceeding, but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for covering
35	our retreat.
35	
35	'I don't know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must
35	be in the absence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun's
35	heat is rarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused by
35	dewdrops, as is sometimes the case in more tropical districts.
35	Lightning may blast and blacken, but it rarely gives rise to
35	widespread fire. Decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with
35	the heat of its fermentation, but this rarely results in flame. In
35	this decadence, too, the art of fire-making had been forgotten on
35	the earth. The red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood were
35	an altogether new and strange thing to Weena.
35	
35	'She wanted to run to it and play with it. I believe she would have
35	cast herself into it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up,
35	and in spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the
35	wood. For a little way the glare of my fire lit the path. Looking
35	back presently, I could see, through the crowded stems, that from my
35	heap of sticks the blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent, and a
35	curved line of fire was creeping up the grass of the hill. I laughed
35	at that, and turned again to the dark trees before me. It was very
35	black, and Weena clung to me convulsively, but there was still, as
35	my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, sufficient light for me to
35	avoid the stems. Overhead it was simply black, except where a gap of
35	remote blue sky shone down upon us here and there. I struck none of
35	my matches because I had no hand free. Upon my left arm I carried my
35	little one, in my right hand I had my iron bar.
35	
35	'For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet,
35	the faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the
35	throb of the blood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of a
35	pattering about me. I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew more
35	distinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I had
35	heard in the Under-world. There were evidently several of the
35	Morlocks, and they were closing in upon me. Indeed, in another
35	minute I felt a tug at my coat, then something at my arm. And Weena
35	shivered violently, and became quite still.
35	
35	'It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did
35	so, and, as I fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the
35	darkness about my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the
35	same peculiar cooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands,
35	too, were creeping over my coat and back, touching even my neck.
35	Then the match scratched and fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the
35	white backs of the Morlocks in flight amid the trees. I hastily took
35	a lump of camphor from my pocket, and prepared to light it as soon
35	as the match should wane. Then I looked at Weena. She was lying
35	clutching my feet and quite motionless, with her face to the ground.
35	With a sudden fright I stooped to her. She seemed scarcely to
35	breathe. I lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground,
35	and as it split and flared up and drove back the Morlocks and the
35	shadows, I knelt down and lifted her. The wood behind seemed full of
35	the stir and murmur of a great company!
35	
35	'She seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder
35	and rose to push on, and then there came a horrible realization. In
35	manoeuvring with my matches and Weena, I had turned myself about
35	several times, and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction
35	lay my path. For all I knew, I might be facing back towards the
35	Palace of Green Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to
35	think rapidly what to do. I determined to build a fire and encamp
35	where we were. I put Weena, still motionless, down upon a turfy
35	bole, and very hastily, as my first lump of camphor waned, I began
35	collecting sticks and leaves. Here and there out of the darkness
35	round me the Morlocks' eyes shone like carbuncles.
35	
35	'The camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so,
35	two white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away.
35	One was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and I
35	felt his bones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop of
35	dismay, staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece
35	of camphor, and went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed
35	how dry was some of the foliage above me, for since my arrival
35	on the Time Machine, a matter of a week, no rain had fallen. So,
35	instead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs, I began
35	leaping up and dragging down branches. Very soon I had a choking
35	smoky fire of green wood and dry sticks, and could economize my
35	camphor. Then I turned to where Weena lay beside my iron mace. I
35	tried what I could to revive her, but she lay like one dead. I could
35	not even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed.
35	
35	'Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have
35	made me heavy of a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in
35	the air. My fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. I
35	felt very weary after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was
35	full of a slumbrous murmur that I did not understand. I seemed just
35	to nod and open my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had
35	their hands upon me. Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily
35	felt in my pocket for the match-box, and--it had gone! Then they
35	gripped and closed with me again. In a moment I knew what had
35	happened. I had slept, and my fire had gone out, and the bitterness
35	of death came over my soul. The forest seemed full of the smell of
35	burning wood. I was caught by the neck, by the hair, by the arms,
35	and pulled down. It was indescribably horrible in the darkness to
35	feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt as if I was in
35	a monstrous spider's web. I was overpowered, and went down. I felt
35	little teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I did so my
35	hand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I struggled
35	up, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar short,
35	I thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could feel the
35	succulent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, and for a moment
35	I was free.
35	
35	'The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard
35	fighting came upon me. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I
35	determined to make the Morlocks pay for their meat. I stood with my
35	back to a tree, swinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood was
35	full of the stir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices
35	seemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement, and their movements
35	grew faster. Yet none came within reach. I stood glaring at the
35	blackness. Then suddenly came hope. What if the Morlocks were
35	afraid? And close on the heels of that came a strange thing. The
35	darkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly I began to see the
35	Morlocks about me--three battered at my feet--and then I recognized,
35	with incredulous surprise, that the others were running, in an
35	incessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through the
35	wood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish.
35	As I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap
35	of starlight between the branches, and vanish. And at that I
35	understood the smell of burning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was
35	growing now into a gusty roar, the red glow, and the Morlocks'
35	flight.
35	
35	'Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through
35	the black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning
35	forest. It was my first fire coming after me. With that I looked for
35	Weena, but she was gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the
35	explosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame, left little
35	time for reflection. My iron bar still gripped, I followed in the
35	Morlocks' path. It was a close race. Once the flames crept forward
35	so swiftly on my right as I ran that I was outflanked and had to
35	strike off to the left. But at last I emerged upon a small open
35	space, and as I did so, a Morlock came blundering towards me, and
35	past me, and went on straight into the fire!
35	
35	'And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of
35	all that I beheld in that future age. This whole space was as bright
35	as day with the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock
35	or tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this was
35	another arm of the burning forest, with yellow tongues already
35	writhing from it, completely encircling the space with a fence of
35	fire. Upon the hill-side were some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled
35	by the light and heat, and blundering hither and thither against
35	each other in their bewilderment. At first I did not realize their
35	blindness, and struck furiously at them with my bar, in a frenzy of
35	fear, as they approached me, killing one and crippling several more.
35	But when I had watched the gestures of one of them groping under the
35	hawthorn against the red sky, and heard their moans, I was assured
35	of their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare, and I struck
35	no more of them.
35	
35	'Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me, setting
35	loose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him. At one
35	time the flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures
35	would presently be able to see me. I was thinking of beginning the
35	fight by killing some of them before this should happen; but the
35	fire burst out again brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about
35	the hill among them and avoided them, looking for some trace of
35	Weena. But Weena was gone.
35	
35	'At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this
35	strange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and
35	making uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat
35	on them. The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and
35	through the rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they
35	belonged to another universe, shone the little stars. Two or three
35	Morlocks came blundering into me, and I drove them off with blows
35	of my fists, trembling as I did so.
35	
35	'For the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare.
35	I bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beat
35	the ground with my hands, and got up and sat down again, and
35	wandered here and there, and again sat down. Then I would fall to
35	rubbing my eyes and calling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I saw
35	Morlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and rush into the
35	flames. But, at last, above the subsiding red of the fire, above the
35	streaming masses of black smoke and the whitening and blackening
35	tree stumps, and the diminishing numbers of these dim creatures,
35	came the white light of the day.
35	
35	'I searched again for traces of Weena, but there were none. It was
35	plain that they had left her poor little body in the forest. I
35	cannot describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the
35	awful fate to which it seemed destined. As I thought of that, I was
35	almost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about
35	me, but I contained myself. The hillock, as I have said, was a kind
35	of island in the forest. From its summit I could now make out
35	through a haze of smoke the Palace of Green Porcelain, and from that
35	I could get my bearings for the White Sphinx. And so, leaving the
35	remnant of these damned souls still going hither and thither and
35	moaning, as the day grew clearer, I tied some grass about my feet
35	and limped on across smoking ashes and among black stems, that still
35	pulsated internally with fire, towards the hiding-place of the Time
35	Machine. I walked slowly, for I was almost exhausted, as well as
35	lame, and I felt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death
35	of little Weena. It seemed an overwhelming calamity. Now, in this
35	old familiar room, it is more like the sorrow of a dream than an
35	actual loss. But that morning it left me absolutely lonely
35	again--terribly alone. I began to think of this house of mine, of
35	this fireside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came a longing
35	that was pain.
35	
35	'But as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning
35	sky, I made a discovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loose
35	matches. The box must have leaked before it was lost.
35	
35	
35	
35	
35	X
35	
35	
35	'About eight or nine in the morning I came to the same seat of
35	yellow metal from which I had viewed the world upon the evening of
35	my arrival. I thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and
35	could not refrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence. Here
35	was the same beautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the same
35	splendid palaces and magnificent ruins, the same silver river
35	running between its fertile banks. The gay robes of the beautiful
35	people moved hither and thither among the trees. Some were bathing
35	in exactly the place where I had saved Weena, and that suddenly gave
35	me a keen stab of pain. And like blots upon the landscape rose the
35	cupolas above the ways to the Under-world. I understood now what all
35	the beauty of the Over-world people covered. Very pleasant was their
35	day, as pleasant as the day of the cattle in the field. Like the
35	cattle, they knew of no enemies and provided against no needs. And
35	their end was the same.
35	
35	'I grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had
35	been. It had committed suicide. It had set itself steadfastly
35	towards comfort and ease, a balanced society with security and
35	permanency as its watchword, it had attained its hopes--to come
35	to this at last. Once, life and property must have reached almost
35	absolute safety. The rich had been assured of his wealth and
35	comfort, the toiler assured of his life and work. No doubt in that
35	perfect world there had been no unemployed problem, no social
35	question left unsolved. And a great quiet had followed.
35	
35	'It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility
35	is the compensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal
35	perfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism.
35	Nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are
35	useless. There is no intelligence where there is no change and no
35	need of change. Only those animals partake of intelligence that have
35	to meet a huge variety of needs and dangers.
35	
35	'So, as I see it, the Upper-world man had drifted towards his
35	feeble prettiness, and the Under-world to mere mechanical industry.
35	But that perfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanical
35	perfection--absolute permanency. Apparently as time went on, the
35	feeding of the Under-world, however it was effected, had become
35	disjointed. Mother Necessity, who had been staved off for a
35	few thousand years, came back again, and she began below. The
35	Under-world being in contact with machinery, which, however perfect,
35	still needs some little thought outside habit, had probably retained
35	perforce rather more initiative, if less of every other human
35	character, than the Upper. And when other meat failed them, they
35	turned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden. So I say I saw it
35	in my last view of the world of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven
35	Hundred and One. It may be as wrong an explanation as mortal wit
35	could invent. It is how the thing shaped itself to me, and as that I
35	give it to you.
35	
35	'After the fatigues, excitements, and terrors of the past days, and
35	in spite of my grief, this seat and the tranquil view and the warm
35	sunlight were very pleasant. I was very tired and sleepy, and soon
35	my theorizing passed into dozing. Catching myself at that, I took my
35	own hint, and spreading myself out upon the turf I had a long and
35	refreshing sleep.
35	
35	'I awoke a little before sunsetting. I now felt safe against being
35	caught napping by the Morlocks, and, stretching myself, I came on
35	down the hill towards the White Sphinx. I had my crowbar in one
35	hand, and the other hand played with the matches in my pocket.
35	
35	'And now came a most unexpected thing. As I approached the pedestal
35	of the sphinx I found the bronze valves were open. They had slid
35	down into grooves.
35	
35	'At that I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter.
35	
35	'Within was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the corner
35	of this was the Time Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket.
35	So here, after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the
35	White Sphinx, was a meek surrender. I threw my iron bar away, almost
35	sorry not to use it.
35	
35	'A sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towards the portal.
35	For once, at least, I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks.
35	Suppressing a strong inclination to laugh, I stepped through the
35	bronze frame and up to the Time Machine. I was surprised to find it
35	had been carefully oiled and cleaned. I have suspected since that
35	the Morlocks had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in
35	their dim way to grasp its purpose.
35	
35	'Now as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the mere
35	touch of the contrivance, the thing I had expected happened. The
35	bronze panels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang.
35	I was in the dark--trapped. So the Morlocks thought. At that I
35	chuckled gleefully.
35	
35	'I could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards
35	me. Very calmly I tried to strike the match. I had only to fix on
35	the levers and depart then like a ghost. But I had overlooked one
35	little thing. The matches were of that abominable kind that light
35	only on the box.
35	
35	'You may imagine how all my calm vanished. The little brutes were
35	close upon me. One touched me. I made a sweeping blow in the dark at
35	them with the levers, and began to scramble into the saddle of the
35	machine. Then came one hand upon me and then another. Then I had
35	simply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers, and
35	at the same time feel for the studs over which these fitted. One,
35	indeed, they almost got away from me. As it slipped from my hand,
35	I had to butt in the dark with my head--I could hear the Morlock's
35	skull ring--to recover it. It was a nearer thing than the fight in
35	the forest, I think, this last scramble.
35	
35	'But at last the lever was fitted and pulled over. The clinging
35	hands slipped from me. The darkness presently fell from my eyes.
35	I found myself in the same grey light and tumult I have already
35	described.
35	
35	
35	
35	
35	XI
35	
35	
35	'I have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes
35	with time travelling. And this time I was not seated properly in the
35	saddle, but sideways and in an unstable fashion. For an indefinite
35	time I clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated, quite
35	unheeding how I went, and when I brought myself to look at the dials
35	again I was amazed to find where I had arrived. One dial records
35	days, and another thousands of days, another millions of days, and
35	another thousands of millions. Now, instead of reversing the levers,
35	I had pulled them over so as to go forward with them, and when I
35	came to look at these indicators I found that the thousands hand was
35	sweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a watch--into
35	futurity.
35	
35	'As I drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appearance of
35	things. The palpitating greyness grew darker; then--though I was
35	still travelling with prodigious velocity--the blinking succession
35	of day and night, which was usually indicative of a slower pace,
35	returned, and grew more and more marked. This puzzled me very much
35	at first. The alternations of night and day grew slower and slower,
35	and so did the passage of the sun across the sky, until they seemed
35	to stretch through centuries. At last a steady twilight brooded over
35	the earth, a twilight only broken now and then when a comet glared
35	across the darkling sky. The band of light that had indicated the
35	sun had long since disappeared; for the sun had ceased to set--it
35	simply rose and fell in the west, and grew ever broader and more
35	red. All trace of the moon had vanished. The circling of the stars,
35	growing slower and slower, had given place to creeping points of
35	light. At last, some time before I stopped, the sun, red and very
35	large, halted motionless upon the horizon, a vast dome glowing with
35	a dull heat, and now and then suffering a momentary extinction. At
35	one time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again,
35	but it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat. I perceived by this
35	slowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidal
35	drag was done. The earth had come to rest with one face to the sun,
35	even as in our own time the moon faces the earth. Very cautiously,
35	for I remembered my former headlong fall, I began to reverse
35	my motion. Slower and slower went the circling hands until the
35	thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longer a
35	mere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim outlines of a
35	desolate beach grew visible.
35	
35	'I stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round.
35	The sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black,
35	and out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale
35	white stars. Overhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and
35	south-eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by
35	the horizon, lay the huge hull of the sun, red and motionless. The
35	rocks about me were of a harsh reddish colour, and all the trace of
35	life that I could see at first was the intensely green vegetation
35	that covered every projecting point on their south-eastern face. It
35	was the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the
35	lichen in caves: plants which like these grow in a perpetual
35	twilight.
35	
35	'The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away
35	to the south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the
35	wan sky. There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of
35	wind was stirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a
35	gentle breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving
35	and living. And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was
35	a thick incrustation of salt--pink under the lurid sky. There was a
35	sense of oppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathing
35	very fast. The sensation reminded me of my only experience of
35	mountaineering, and from that I judged the air to be more rarefied
35	than it is now.
35	
35	'Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a
35	thing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into
35	the sky and, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The
35	sound of its voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself
35	more firmly upon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that,
35	quite near, what I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving
35	slowly towards me. Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous
35	crab-like creature. Can you imagine a crab as large as yonder table,
35	with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly, its big claws
35	swaying, its long antennae, like carters' whips, waving and feeling,
35	and its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic
35	front? Its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses,
35	and a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there. I could see
35	the many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it
35	moved.
35	
35	'As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt
35	a tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to
35	brush it away with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost
35	immediately came another by my ear. I struck at this, and caught
35	something threadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With a
35	frightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna
35	of another monster crab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyes
35	were wriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive with
35	appetite, and its vast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime,
35	were descending upon me. In a moment my hand was on the lever, and
35	I had placed a month between myself and these monsters. But I was
35	still on the same beach, and I saw them distinctly now as soon as I
35	stopped. Dozens of them seemed to be crawling here and there, in the
35	sombre light, among the foliated sheets of intense green.
35	
35	'I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over
35	the world. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt
35	Dead Sea, the stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirring
35	monsters, the uniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous
35	plants, the thin air that hurts one's lungs: all contributed to an
35	appalling effect. I moved on a hundred years, and there was the same
35	red sun--a little larger, a little duller--the same dying sea, the
35	same chill air, and the same crowd of earthy crustacea creeping in
35	and out among the green weed and the red rocks. And in the westward
35	sky, I saw a curved pale line like a vast new moon.
35	
35	'So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a
35	thousand years or more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth's fate,
35	watching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller
35	in the westward sky, and the life of the old earth ebb away. At
35	last, more than thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of
35	the sun had come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling
35	heavens. Then I stopped once more, for the crawling multitude of
35	crabs had disappeared, and the red beach, save for its livid green
35	liverworts and lichens, seemed lifeless. And now it was flecked with
35	white. A bitter cold assailed me. Rare white flakes ever and again
35	came eddying down. To the north-eastward, the glare of snow lay
35	under the starlight of the sable sky and I could see an undulating
35	crest of hillocks pinkish white. There were fringes of ice along the
35	sea margin, with drifting masses further out; but the main expanse
35	of that salt ocean, all bloody under the eternal sunset, was still
35	unfrozen.
35	
35	'I looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A
35	certain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the
35	machine. But I saw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green
35	slime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct. A
35	shallow sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded
35	from the beach. I fancied I saw some black object flopping about
35	upon this bank, but it became motionless as I looked at it, and I
35	judged that my eye had been deceived, and that the black object was
35	merely a rock. The stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed
35	to me to twinkle very little.
35	
35	'Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun
35	had changed; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I
35	saw this grow larger. For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this
35	blackness that was creeping over the day, and then I realized that
35	an eclipse was beginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was
35	passing across the sun's disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be
35	the moon, but there is much to incline me to believe that what I
35	really saw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near to
35	the earth.
35	
35	'The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening
35	gusts from the east, and the showering white flakes in the air
35	increased in number. From the edge of the sea came a ripple and
35	whisper. Beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent?
35	It would be hard to convey the stillness of it. All the sounds of
35	man, the bleating of sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects,
35	the stir that makes the background of our lives--all that was over.
35	As the darkness thickened, the eddying flakes grew more abundant,
35	dancing before my eyes; and the cold of the air more intense. At
35	last, one by one, swiftly, one after the other, the white peaks of
35	the distant hills vanished into blackness. The breeze rose to a
35	moaning wind. I saw the black central shadow of the eclipse sweeping
35	towards me. In another moment the pale stars alone were visible. All
35	else was rayless obscurity. The sky was absolutely black.
35	
35	'A horror of this great darkness came on me. The cold, that smote
35	to my marrow, and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I
35	shivered, and a deadly nausea seized me. Then like a red-hot bow
35	in the sky appeared the edge of the sun. I got off the machine to
35	recover myself. I felt giddy and incapable of facing the return
35	journey. As I stood sick and confused I saw again the moving thing
35	upon the shoal--there was no mistake now that it was a moving
35	thing--against the red water of the sea. It was a round thing, the
35	size of a football perhaps, or, it may be, bigger, and tentacles
35	trailed down from it; it seemed black against the weltering
35	blood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then I felt I
35	was fainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote
35	and awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the saddle.
35	
35	
35	
35	
35	XII
35	
35	
35	'So I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible upon
35	the machine. The blinking succession of the days and nights was
35	resumed, the sun got golden again, the sky blue. I breathed with
35	greater freedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and
35	flowed. The hands spun backward upon the dials. At last I saw again
35	the dim shadows of houses, the evidences of decadent humanity.
35	These, too, changed and passed, and others came. Presently, when the
35	million dial was at zero, I slackened speed. I began to recognize
35	our own pretty and familiar architecture, the thousands hand ran back
35	to the starting-point, the night and day flapped slower and slower.
35	Then the old walls of the laboratory came round me. Very gently,
35	now, I slowed the mechanism down.
35	
35	'I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have told
35	you that when I set out, before my velocity became very high, Mrs.
35	Watchett had walked across the room, travelling, as it seemed to me,
35	like a rocket. As I returned, I passed again across that minute when
35	she traversed the laboratory. But now her every motion appeared to
35	be the exact inversion of her previous ones. The door at the lower
35	end opened, and she glided quietly up the laboratory, back foremost,
35	and disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered.
35	Just before that I seemed to see Hillyer for a moment; but he passed
35	like a flash.
35	
35	'Then I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar
35	laboratory, my tools, my appliances just as I had left them. I got
35	off the thing very shakily, and sat down upon my bench. For several
35	minutes I trembled violently. Then I became calmer. Around me was
35	my old workshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have slept
35	there, and the whole thing have been a dream.
35	
35	'And yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-east
35	corner of the laboratory. It had come to rest again in the
35	north-west, against the wall where you saw it. That gives you the
35	exact distance from my little lawn to the pedestal of the White
35	Sphinx, into which the Morlocks had carried my machine.
35	
35	'For a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and came
35	through the passage here, limping, because my heel was still
35	painful, and feeling sorely begrimed. I saw the _Pall Mall Gazette_
35	on the table by the door. I found the date was indeed to-day, and
35	looking at the timepiece, saw the hour was almost eight o'clock. I
35	heard your voices and the clatter of plates. I hesitated--I felt so
35	sick and weak. Then I sniffed good wholesome meat, and opened the
35	door on you. You know the rest. I washed, and dined, and now I am
35	telling you the story.
35	
35	'I know,' he said, after a pause, 'that all this will be absolutely
35	incredible to you. To me the one incredible thing is that I am here
35	to-night in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces
35	and telling you these strange adventures.'
35	
35	He looked at the Medical Man. 'No. I cannot expect you to believe
35	it. Take it as a lie--or a prophecy. Say I dreamed it in the
35	workshop. Consider I have been speculating upon the destinies of our
35	race until I have hatched this fiction. Treat my assertion of its
35	truth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest. And taking
35	it as a story, what do you think of it?'
35	
35	He took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap
35	with it nervously upon the bars of the grate. There was a momentary
35	stillness. Then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the
35	carpet. I took my eyes off the Time Traveller's face, and looked
35	round at his audience. They were in the dark, and little spots of
35	colour swam before them. The Medical Man seemed absorbed in the
35	contemplation of our host. The Editor was looking hard at the end
35	of his cigar--the sixth. The Journalist fumbled for his watch. The
35	others, as far as I remember, were motionless.
35	
35	The Editor stood up with a sigh. 'What a pity it is you're not
35	a writer of stories!' he said, putting his hand on the Time
35	Traveller's shoulder.
35	
35	'You don't believe it?'
35	
35	'Well----'
35	
35	'I thought not.'
35	
35	The Time Traveller turned to us. 'Where are the matches?' he said.
35	He lit one and spoke over his pipe, puffing. 'To tell you the truth
35	... I hardly believe it myself.... And yet...'
35	
35	His eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers
35	upon the little table. Then he turned over the hand holding his
35	pipe, and I saw he was looking at some half-healed scars on his
35	knuckles.
35	
35	The Medical Man rose, came to the lamp, and examined the flowers.
35	'The gynaeceum's odd,' he said. The Psychologist leant forward to
35	see, holding out his hand for a specimen.
35	
35	'I'm hanged if it isn't a quarter to one,' said the Journalist.
35	'How shall we get home?'
35	
35	'Plenty of cabs at the station,' said the Psychologist.
35	
35	'It's a curious thing,' said the Medical Man; 'but I certainly don't
35	know the natural order of these flowers. May I have them?'
35	
35	The Time Traveller hesitated. Then suddenly: 'Certainly not.'
35	
35	'Where did you really get them?' said the Medical Man.
35	
35	The Time Traveller put his hand to his head. He spoke like one who
35	was trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him. 'They were put
35	into my pocket by Weena, when I travelled into Time.' He stared
35	round the room. 'I'm damned if it isn't all going. This room and you
35	and the atmosphere of every day is too much for my memory. Did I
35	ever make a Time Machine, or a model of a Time Machine? Or is it all
35	only a dream? They say life is a dream, a precious poor dream at
35	times--but I can't stand another that won't fit. It's madness. And
35	where did the dream come from? ... I must look at that machine. If
35	there is one!'
35	
35	He caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through
35	the door into the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickering
35	light of the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and
35	askew; a thing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering
35	quartz. Solid to the touch--for I put out my hand and felt the rail
35	of it--and with brown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of
35	grass and moss upon the lower parts, and one rail bent awry.
35	
35	The Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand
35	along the damaged rail. 'It's all right now,' he said. 'The story I
35	told you was true. I'm sorry to have brought you out here in the
35	cold.' He took up the lamp, and, in an absolute silence, we
35	returned to the smoking-room.
35	
35	He came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his
35	coat. The Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certain
35	hesitation, told him he was suffering from overwork, at which he
35	laughed hugely. I remember him standing in the open doorway, bawling
35	good night.
35	
35	I shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a 'gaudy lie.'
35	For my own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story was
35	so fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I
35	lay awake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to go
35	next day and see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the
35	laboratory, and being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him.
35	The laboratory, however, was empty. I stared for a minute at the
35	Time Machine and put out my hand and touched the lever. At that the
35	squat substantial-looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the
35	wind. Its instability startled me extremely, and I had a queer
35	reminiscence of the childish days when I used to be forbidden to
35	meddle. I came back through the corridor. The Time Traveller met me
35	in the smoking-room. He was coming from the house. He had a small
35	camera under one arm and a knapsack under the other. He laughed when
35	he saw me, and gave me an elbow to shake. 'I'm frightfully busy,'
35	said he, 'with that thing in there.'
35	
35	'But is it not some hoax?' I said. 'Do you really travel through
35	time?'
35	
35	'Really and truly I do.' And he looked frankly into my eyes. He
35	hesitated. His eye wandered about the room. 'I only want half an
35	hour,' he said. 'I know why you came, and it's awfully good of you.
35	There's some magazines here. If you'll stop to lunch I'll prove you
35	this time travelling up to the hilt, specimen and all. If you'll
35	forgive my leaving you now?'
35	
35	I consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words,
35	and he nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of
35	the laboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily
35	paper. What was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly
35	I was reminded by an advertisement that I had promised to meet
35	Richardson, the publisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw
35	that I could barely save that engagement. I got up and went down the
35	passage to tell the Time Traveller.
35	
35	As I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation,
35	oddly truncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air
35	whirled round me as I opened the door, and from within came the
35	sound of broken glass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was
35	not there. I seemed to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in
35	a whirling mass of black and brass for a moment--a figure so
35	transparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings was
35	absolutely distinct; but this phantasm vanished as I rubbed my eyes.
35	The Time Machine had gone. Save for a subsiding stir of dust, the
35	further end of the laboratory was empty. A pane of the skylight had,
35	apparently, just been blown in.
35	
35	I felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had
35	happened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange
35	thing might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened,
35	and the man-servant appeared.
35	
35	We looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. 'Has Mr. ----
35	gone out that way?' said I.
35	
35	'No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him
35	here.'
35	
35	At that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I
35	stayed on, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second,
35	perhaps still stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he
35	would bring with him. But I am beginning now to fear that I must
35	wait a lifetime. The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And,
35	as everybody knows now, he has never returned.
35	
35	
35	
35	
35	EPILOGUE
35	
35	
35	One cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he
35	swept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy
35	savages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the
35	Cretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian
35	brutes of the Jurassic times. He may even now--if I may use the
35	phrase--be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral
35	reef, or beside the lonely saline lakes of the Triassic Age. Or did
35	he go forward, into one of the nearer ages, in which men are still
35	men, but with the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome
35	problems solved? Into the manhood of the race: for I, for my own
35	part, cannot think that these latter days of weak experiment,
35	fragmentary theory, and mutual discord are indeed man's culminating
35	time! I say, for my own part. He, I know--for the question had been
35	discussed among us long before the Time Machine was made--thought
35	but cheerlessly of the Advancement of Mankind, and saw in the
35	growing pile of civilization only a foolish heaping that must
35	inevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end. If that
35	is so, it remains for us to live as though it were not so. But to me
35	the future is still black and blank--is a vast ignorance, lit at a
35	few casual places by the memory of his story. And I have by me, for
35	my comfort, two strange white flowers--shrivelled now, and brown and
35	flat and brittle--to witness that even when mind and strength had
35	gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart
35	of man.

36	CHAPTER ONE
36	
36	THE EVE OF THE WAR
36	
36	
36	No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth
36	century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by
36	intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as
36	men busied themselves about their various concerns they were
36	scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a
36	microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and
36	multiply in a drop of water.  With infinite complacency men went to
36	and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their
36	assurance of their empire over matter.  It is possible that the
36	infusoria under the microscope do the same.  No one gave a thought to
36	the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of
36	them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or
36	improbable.  It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of
36	those departed days.  At most terrestrial men fancied there might be
36	other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to
36	welcome a missionary enterprise.  Yet across the gulf of space, minds
36	that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish,
36	intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with
36	envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.  And
36	early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.
36	
36	The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the
36	sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it
36	receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world.
36	It must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our
36	world; and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its
36	surface must have begun its course.  The fact that it is scarcely one
36	seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling
36	to the temperature at which life could begin.  It has air and water
36	and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence.
36	
36	Yet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer,
36	up to the very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea that
36	intelligent life might have developed there far, or indeed at all,
36	beyond its earthly level.  Nor was it generally understood that since
36	Mars is older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter of the
36	superficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows that
36	it is not only more distant from time's beginning but nearer its end.
36	
36	The secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has
36	already gone far indeed with our neighbour.  Its physical condition is
36	still largely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorial
36	region the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest
36	winter.  Its air is much more attenuated than ours, its oceans have
36	shrunk until they cover but a third of its surface, and as its slow
36	seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and
36	periodically inundate its temperate zones.  That last stage of
36	exhaustion, which to us is still incredibly remote, has become a
36	present-day problem for the inhabitants of Mars.  The immediate
36	pressure of necessity has brightened their intellects, enlarged their
36	powers, and hardened their hearts.  And looking across space with
36	instruments, and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of,
36	they see, at its nearest distance only 35,000,000 of miles sunward of
36	them, a morning star of hope, our own warmer planet, green with
36	vegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of
36	fertility, with glimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad
36	stretches of populous country and narrow, navy-crowded seas.
36	
36	And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them
36	at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us.  The
36	intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant
36	struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief
36	of the minds upon Mars.  Their world is far gone in its cooling and
36	this world is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they
36	regard as inferior animals.  To carry warfare sunward is, indeed,
36	their only escape from the destruction that, generation after
36	generation, creeps upon them.
36	
36	And before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what
36	ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only
36	upon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its
36	inferior races.  The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness,
36	were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged
36	by European immigrants, in the space of fifty years.  Are we such
36	apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same
36	spirit?
36	
36	The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing
36	subtlety--their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of
36	ours--and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh
36	perfect unanimity.  Had our instruments permitted it, we might have
36	seen the gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century.  Men
36	like Schiaparelli watched the red planet--it is odd, by-the-bye, that
36	for countless centuries Mars has been the star of war--but failed to
36	interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so
36	well.  All that time the Martians must have been getting ready.
36	
36	During the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the
36	illuminated part of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by
36	Perrotin of Nice, and then by other observers.  English readers heard
36	of it first in the issue of _Nature_ dated August 2.  I am inclined to
36	think that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun, in
36	the vast pit sunk into their planet, from which their shots were fired
36	at us.  Peculiar markings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the site
36	of that outbreak during the next two oppositions.
36	
36	The storm burst upon us six years ago now.  As Mars approached
36	opposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchange
36	palpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of
36	incandescent gas upon the planet.  It had occurred towards midnight of
36	the twelfth; and the spectroscope, to which he had at once resorted,
36	indicated a mass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an
36	enormous velocity towards this earth.  This jet of fire had become
36	invisible about a quarter past twelve.  He compared it to a colossal
36	puff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet, ""as
36	flaming gases rushed out of a gun.""
36	
36	A singularly appropriate phrase it proved.  Yet the next day there
36	was nothing of this in the papers except a little note in the _Daily
36	Telegraph_, and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest
36	dangers that ever threatened the human race. I might not have heard of
36	the eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy, the well-known astronomer,
36	at Ottershaw.  He was immensely excited at the news, and in the excess
36	of his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a
36	scrutiny of the red planet.
36	
36	In spite of all that has happened since, I still remember that
36	vigil very distinctly: the black and silent observatory, the shadowed
36	lantern throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner, the
36	steady ticking of the clockwork of the telescope, the little slit in
36	the roof--an oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it.
36	Ogilvy moved about, invisible but audible.  Looking through the
36	telescope, one saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
36	swimming in the field.  It seemed such a little thing, so bright and
36	small and still, faintly marked with transverse stripes, and slightly
36	flattened from the perfect round.  But so little it was, so silvery
36	warm--a pin's-head of light! It was as if it quivered, but really this
36	was the telescope vibrating with the activity of the clockwork that
36	kept the planet in view.
36	
36	As I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to
36	advance and recede, but that was simply that my eye was tired.  Forty
36	millions of miles it was from us--more than forty millions of miles of
36	void.  Few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust
36	of the material universe swims.
36	
36	Near it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of light,
36	three telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around it was the
36	unfathomable darkness of empty space.  You know how that blackness
36	looks on a frosty starlight night.  In a telescope it seems far
36	profounder.  And invisible to me because it was so remote and small,
36	flying swiftly and steadily towards me across that incredible
36	distance, drawing nearer every minute by so many thousands of miles,
36	came the Thing they were sending us, the Thing that was to bring so
36	much struggle and calamity and death to the earth.  I never dreamed of
36	it then as I watched; no one on earth dreamed of that unerring
36	missile.
36	
36	That night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from the
36	distant planet.  I saw it.  A reddish flash at the edge, the slightest
36	projection of the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and
36	at that I told Ogilvy and he took my place.  The night was warm and I
36	was thirsty, and I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way
36	in the darkness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while
36	Ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us.
36	
36	That night another invisible missile started on its way to the
36	earth from Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the
36	first one.  I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness,
36	with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes.  I wished I
36	had a light to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute
36	gleam I had seen and all that it would presently bring me.  Ogilvy
36	watched till one, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and
36	walked over to his house.  Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw
36	and Chertsey and all their hundreds of people, sleeping in peace.
36	
36	He was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars,
36	and scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were
36	signalling us.  His idea was that meteorites might be falling in a
36	heavy shower upon the planet, or that a huge volcanic explosion was in
36	progress.  He pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic
36	evolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets.
36	
36	""The chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million to
36	one,"" he said.
36	
36	Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
36	about midnight, and again the night after; and so for ten nights, a
36	flame each night.  Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on
36	earth has attempted to explain.  It may be the gases of the firing
36	caused the Martians inconvenience.  Dense clouds of smoke or dust,
36	visible through a powerful telescope on earth as little grey,
36	fluctuating patches, spread through the clearness of the planet's
36	atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features.
36	
36	Even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last, and
36	popular notes appeared here, there, and everywhere concerning the
36	volcanoes upon Mars.  The seriocomic periodical _Punch_, I remember,
36	made a happy use of it in the political cartoon.  And, all
36	unsuspected, those missiles the Martians had fired at us drew
36	earthward, rushing now at a pace of many miles a second through the
36	empty gulf of space, hour by hour and day by day, nearer and nearer.
36	It seems to me now almost incredibly wonderful that, with that swift
36	fate hanging over us, men could go about their petty concerns as they
36	did.  I remember how jubilant Markham was at securing a new photograph
36	of the planet for the illustrated paper he edited in those days.
36	People in these latter times scarcely realise the abundance and
36	enterprise of our nineteenth-century papers.  For my own part, I was
36	much occupied in learning to ride the bicycle, and busy upon a series
36	of papers discussing the probable developments of moral ideas as
36	civilisation progressed.
36	
36	One night (the first missile then could scarcely have been
36	10,000,000 miles away) I went for a walk with my wife.  It was
36	starlight and I explained the Signs of the Zodiac to her, and pointed
36	out Mars, a bright dot of light creeping zenithward, towards which so
36	many telescopes were pointed.  It was a warm night.  Coming home, a
36	party of excursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing
36	and playing music.  There were lights in the upper windows of the
36	houses as the people went to bed.  From the railway station in the
36	distance came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling,
36	softened almost into melody by the distance.  My wife pointed out to
36	me the brightness of the red, green, and yellow signal lights hanging
36	in a framework against the sky.  It seemed so safe and tranquil.
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER TWO
36	
36	THE FALLING STAR
36	
36	
36	Then came the night of the first falling star.  It was seen early
36	in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high
36	in the atmosphere.  Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an
36	ordinary falling star.  Albin described it as leaving a greenish
36	streak behind it that glowed for some seconds.  Denning, our greatest
36	authority on meteorites, stated that the height of its first
36	appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles.  It seemed to him
36	that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him.
36	
36	I was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my
36	French windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I
36	loved in those days to look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it.
36	Yet this strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer
36	space must have fallen while I was sitting there, visible to me had I
36	only looked up as it passed.  Some of those who saw its flight say it
36	travelled with a hissing sound.  I myself heard nothing of that.  Many
36	people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of
36	it, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended.
36	No one seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night.
36	
36	But very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen the
36	shooting star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on
36	the common between Horsell, Ottershaw, and Woking, rose early with the
36	idea of finding it.  Find it he did, soon after dawn, and not far from
36	the sand pits.  An enormous hole had been made by the impact of the
36	projectile, and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every
36	direction over the heath, forming heaps visible a mile and a half
36	away.  The heather was on fire eastward, and a thin blue smoke rose
36	against the dawn.
36	
36	The Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst the
36	scattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its
36	descent.  The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder,
36	caked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly dun-coloured
36	incrustation.  It had a diameter of about thirty yards.  He approached
36	the mass, surprised at the size and more so at the shape, since most
36	meteorites are rounded more or less completely.  It was, however,
36	still so hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near
36	approach.  A stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the
36	unequal cooling of its surface; for at that time it had not occurred
36	to him that it might be hollow.
36	
36	He remained standing at the edge of the pit that the Thing had made
36	for itself, staring at its strange appearance, astonished chiefly at
36	its unusual shape and colour, and dimly perceiving even then some
36	evidence of design in its arrival.  The early morning was wonderfully
36	still, and the sun, just clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge,
36	was already warm.  He did not remember hearing any birds that morning,
36	there was certainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds were the
36	faint movements from within the cindery cylinder.  He was all alone on
36	the common.
36	
36	Then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey
36	clinker, the ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite, was falling
36	off the circular edge of the end.  It was dropping off in flakes and
36	raining down upon the sand.  A large piece suddenly came off and fell
36	with a sharp noise that brought his heart into his mouth.
36	
36	For a minute he scarcely realised what this meant, and, although
36	the heat was excessive, he clambered down into the pit close to the
36	bulk to see the Thing more clearly.  He fancied even then that the
36	cooling of the body might account for this, but what disturbed that
36	idea was the fact that the ash was falling only from the end of the
36	cylinder.
36	
36	And then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top of the
36	cylinder was rotating on its body.  It was such a gradual movement
36	that he discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had
36	been near him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the
36	circumference.  Even then he scarcely understood what this indicated,
36	until he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk
36	forward an inch or so.  Then the thing came upon him in a flash.  The
36	cylinder was artificial--hollow--with an end that screwed out!
36	Something within the cylinder was unscrewing the top!
36	
36	""Good heavens!"" said Ogilvy.  ""There's a man in it--men in it! Half
36	roasted to death!  Trying to escape!""
36	
36	At once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the Thing with the
36	flash upon Mars.
36	
36	The thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that he
36	forgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder to help turn.  But
36	luckily the dull radiation arrested him before he could burn his hands
36	on the still-glowing metal.  At that he stood irresolute for a moment,
36	then turned, scrambled out of the pit, and set off running wildly into
36	Woking.  The time then must have been somewhere about six o'clock.
36	He met a waggoner and tried to make him understand, but the tale he
36	told and his appearance were so wild--his hat had fallen off in the
36	pit--that the man simply drove on.  He was equally unsuccessful with the
36	potman who was just unlocking the doors of the public-house by Horsell
36	Bridge.  The fellow thought he was a lunatic at large and made an
36	unsuccessful attempt to shut him into the taproom.  That sobered him a
36	little; and when he saw Henderson, the London journalist, in his
36	garden, he called over the palings and made himself understood.
36	
36	""Henderson,"" he called, ""you saw that shooting star last night?""
36	
36	""Well?"" said Henderson.
36	
36	""It's out on Horsell Common now.""
36	
36	""Good Lord!"" said Henderson.  ""Fallen meteorite!  That's good.""
36	
36	""But it's something more than a meteorite.  It's a cylinder--an
36	artificial cylinder, man!  And there's something inside.""
36	
36	Henderson stood up with his spade in his hand.
36	
36	""What's that?"" he said.  He was deaf in one ear.
36	
36	Ogilvy told him all that he had seen.  Henderson was a minute or so
36	taking it in.  Then he dropped his spade, snatched up his jacket, and
36	came out into the road.  The two men hurried back at once to the
36	common, and found the cylinder still lying in the same position.  But
36	now the sounds inside had ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal
36	showed between the top and the body of the cylinder.  Air was either
36	entering or escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound.
36	
36	They listened, rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick, and,
36	meeting with no response, they both concluded the man or men inside
36	must be insensible or dead.
36	
36	Of course the two were quite unable to do anything.  They shouted
36	consolation and promises, and went off back to the town again to get
36	help.  One can imagine them, covered with sand, excited and
36	disordered, running up the little street in the bright sunlight just
36	as the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were
36	opening their bedroom windows.  Henderson went into the railway
36	station at once, in order to telegraph the news to London.  The
36	newspaper articles had prepared men's minds for the reception of the
36	idea.
36	
36	By eight o'clock a number of boys and unemployed men had already
36	started for the common to see the ""dead men from Mars.""  That was the
36	form the story took.  I heard of it first from my newspaper boy about
36	a quarter to nine when I went out to get my _Daily Chronicle_.  I was
36	naturally startled, and lost no time in going out and across the
36	Ottershaw bridge to the sand pits.
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER THREE
36	
36	ON HORSELL COMMON
36	
36	
36	I found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the
36	huge hole in which the cylinder lay.  I have already described the
36	appearance of that colossal bulk, embedded in the ground.  The turf
36	and gravel about it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion.  No
36	doubt its impact had caused a flash of fire.  Henderson and Ogilvy
36	were not there.  I think they perceived that nothing was to be done
36	for the present, and had gone away to breakfast at Henderson's house.
36	
36	There were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the Pit, with
36	their feet dangling, and amusing themselves--until I stopped them--by
36	throwing stones at the giant mass.  After I had spoken to them about
36	it, they began playing at ""touch"" in and out of the group of
36	bystanders.
36	
36	Among these were a couple of cyclists, a jobbing gardener I
36	employed sometimes, a girl carrying a baby, Gregg the butcher and his
36	little boy, and two or three loafers and golf caddies who were
36	accustomed to hang about the railway station.  There was very little
36	talking.  Few of the common people in England had anything but the
36	vaguest astronomical ideas in those days.  Most of them were staring
36	quietly at the big table like end of the cylinder, which was still as
36	Ogilvy and Henderson had left it.  I fancy the popular expectation of
36	a heap of charred corpses was disappointed at this inanimate bulk.
36	Some went away while I was there, and other people came.  I clambered
36	into the pit and fancied I heard a faint movement under my feet.  The
36	top had certainly ceased to rotate.
36	
36	It was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness of
36	this object was at all evident to me.  At the first glance it was
36	really no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown
36	across the road.  Not so much so, indeed.  It looked like a rusty gas
36	float.  It required a certain amount of scientific education to
36	perceive that the grey scale of the Thing was no common oxide, that
36	the yellowish-white metal that gleamed in the crack between the lid
36	and the cylinder had an unfamiliar hue.  ""Extra-terrestrial"" had no
36	meaning for most of the onlookers.
36	
36	At that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the Thing had
36	come from the planet Mars, but I judged it improbable that it
36	contained any living creature.  I thought the unscrewing might be
36	automatic.  In spite of Ogilvy, I still believed that there were men
36	in Mars.  My mind ran fancifully on the possibilities of its
36	containing manuscript, on the difficulties in translation that might
36	arise, whether we should find coins and models in it, and so forth.
36	Yet it was a little too large for assurance on this idea.  I felt an
36	impatience to see it opened.  About eleven, as nothing seemed
36	happening, I walked back, full of such thought, to my home in Maybury.
36	But I found it difficult to get to work upon my abstract
36	investigations.
36	
36	In the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered very
36	much.  The early editions of the evening papers had startled London
36	with enormous headlines:
36	
36	  ""A MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS.""
36	
36	  ""REMARKABLE STORY FROM WOKING,""
36	
36	and so forth.  In addition, Ogilvy's wire to the Astronomical Exchange
36	had roused every observatory in the three kingdoms.
36	
36	There were half a dozen flies or more from the Woking station
36	standing in the road by the sand pits, a basket-chaise from Chobham,
36	and a rather lordly carriage.  Besides that, there was quite a heap of
36	bicycles.  In addition, a large number of people must have walked, in
36	spite of the heat of the day, from Woking and Chertsey, so that there
36	was altogether quite a considerable crowd--one or two gaily dressed
36	ladies among the others.
36	
36	It was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind,
36	and the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees.  The
36	burning heather had been extinguished, but the level ground towards
36	Ottershaw was blackened as far as one could see, and still giving off
36	vertical streamers of smoke.  An enterprising sweet-stuff dealer in
36	the Chobham Road had sent up his son with a barrow-load of green
36	apples and ginger beer.
36	
36	Going to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied by a group of
36	about half a dozen men--Henderson, Ogilvy, and a tall, fair-haired man
36	that I afterwards learned was Stent, the Astronomer Royal, with
36	several workmen wielding spades and pickaxes.  Stent was giving
36	directions in a clear, high-pitched voice.  He was standing on the
36	cylinder, which was now evidently much cooler; his face was crimson
36	and streaming with perspiration, and something seemed to have
36	irritated him.
36	
36	A large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered, though its
36	lower end was still embedded.  As soon as Ogilvy saw me among the
36	staring crowd on the edge of the pit he called to me to come down, and
36	asked me if I would mind going over to see Lord Hilton, the lord of
36	the manor.
36	
36	The growing crowd, he said, was becoming a serious impediment to
36	their excavations, especially the boys.  They wanted a light railing
36	put up, and help to keep the people back.  He told me that a faint
36	stirring was occasionally still audible within the case, but that the
36	workmen had failed to unscrew the top, as it afforded no grip to them.
36	The case appeared to be enormously thick, and it was possible that the
36	faint sounds we heard represented a noisy tumult in the interior.
36	
36	I was very glad to do as he asked, and so become one of the
36	privileged spectators within the contemplated enclosure.  I failed to
36	find Lord Hilton at his house, but I was told he was expected from
36	London by the six o'clock train from Waterloo; and as it was then
36	about a quarter past five, I went home, had some tea, and walked up to
36	the station to waylay him.
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER FOUR
36	
36	THE CYLINDER OPENS
36	
36	
36	When I returned to the common the sun was setting.  Scattered groups
36	were hurrying from the direction of Woking, and one or two persons
36	were returning.  The crowd about the pit had increased, and stood out
36	black against the lemon yellow of the sky--a couple of hundred people,
36	perhaps.  There were raised voices, and some sort of struggle appeared
36	to be going on about the pit.  Strange imaginings passed through my
36	mind.  As I drew nearer I heard Stent's voice:
36	
36	""Keep back!  Keep back!""
36	
36	A boy came running towards me.
36	
36	""It's a-movin',"" he said to me as he passed; ""a-screwin' and
36	a-screwin' out.  I don't like it.  I'm a-goin' 'ome, I am.""
36	
36	I went on to the crowd.  There were really, I should think, two or
36	three hundred people elbowing and jostling one another, the one or two
36	ladies there being by no means the least active.
36	
36	""He's fallen in the pit!"" cried some one.
36	
36	""Keep back!"" said several.
36	
36	The crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way through.  Every one
36	seemed greatly excited.  I heard a peculiar humming sound from the
36	pit.
36	
36	""I say!"" said Ogilvy; ""help keep these idiots back.  We don't know
36	what's in the confounded thing, you know!""
36	
36	I saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe he was,
36	standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again.
36	The crowd had pushed him in.
36	
36	The end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within.  Nearly
36	two feet of shining screw projected.  Somebody blundered against me,
36	and I narrowly missed being pitched onto the top of the screw.  I
36	turned, and as I did so the screw must have come out, for the lid of
36	the cylinder fell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion.  I stuck
36	my elbow into the person behind me, and turned my head towards the
36	Thing again.  For a moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black.
36	I had the sunset in my eyes.
36	
36	I think everyone expected to see a man emerge--possibly something a
36	little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man.  I know
36	I did.  But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within the
36	shadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two
36	luminous disks--like eyes.  Then something resembling a little grey
36	snake, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the
36	writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me--and then another.
36	
36	A sudden chill came over me.  There was a loud shriek from a woman
36	behind.  I half turned, keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still,
36	from which other tentacles were now projecting, and began pushing my
36	way back from the edge of the pit.  I saw astonishment giving place to
36	horror on the faces of the people about me.  I heard inarticulate
36	exclamations on all sides.  There was a general movement backwards.
36	I saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit.  I found
36	myself alone, and saw the people on the other side of the pit running
36	off, Stent among them.  I looked again at the cylinder, and
36	ungovernable terror gripped me.  I stood petrified and staring.
36	
36	A big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of a bear, was
36	rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder.  As it bulged up and
36	caught the light, it glistened like wet leather.
36	
36	Two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly.  The
36	mass that framed them, the head of the thing, was rounded, and had,
36	one might say, a face.  There was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless
36	brim of which quivered and panted, and dropped saliva.  The whole
36	creature heaved and pulsated convulsively.  A lank tentacular
36	appendage gripped the edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air.
36	
36	Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the
36	strange horror of its appearance.  The peculiar V-shaped mouth with
36	its pointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the absence of a
36	chin beneath the wedgelike lower lip, the incessant quivering of this
36	mouth, the Gorgon groups of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of the
36	lungs in a strange atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulness
36	of movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth--above
36	all, the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes--were at
36	once vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous.  There was
36	something fungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsy
36	deliberation of the tedious movements unspeakably nasty.  Even at this
36	first encounter, this first glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and
36	dread.
36	
36	Suddenly the monster vanished.  It had toppled over the brim of the
36	cylinder and fallen into the pit, with a thud like the fall of a great
36	mass of leather.  I heard it give a peculiar thick cry, and forthwith
36	another of these creatures appeared darkly in the deep shadow of the
36	aperture.
36	
36	I turned and, running madly, made for the first group of trees,
36	perhaps a hundred yards away; but I ran slantingly and stumbling, for
36	I could not avert my face from these things.
36	
36	There, among some young pine trees and furze bushes, I stopped,
36	panting, and waited further developments.  The common round the sand
36	pits was dotted with people, standing like myself in a half-fascinated
36	terror, staring at these creatures, or rather at the heaped gravel at
36	the edge of the pit in which they lay.  And then, with a renewed
36	horror, I saw a round, black object bobbing up and down on the edge of
36	the pit.  It was the head of the shopman who had fallen in, but
36	showing as a little black object against the hot western sun.  Now he
36	got his shoulder and knee up, and again he seemed to slip back until
36	only his head was visible.  Suddenly he vanished, and I could have
36	fancied a faint shriek had reached me.  I had a momentary impulse to
36	go back and help him that my fears overruled.
36	
36	Everything was then quite invisible, hidden by the deep pit and the
36	heap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made.  Anyone coming
36	along the road from Chobham or Woking would have been amazed at the
36	sight--a dwindling multitude of perhaps a hundred people or more
36	standing in a great irregular circle, in ditches, behind bushes,
36	behind gates and hedges, saying little to one another and that in
36	short, excited shouts, and staring, staring hard at a few heaps of
36	sand.  The barrow of ginger beer stood, a queer derelict, black
36	against the burning sky, and in the sand pits was a row of deserted
36	vehicles with their horses feeding out of nosebags or pawing the
36	ground.
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER FIVE
36	
36	THE HEAT-RAY
36	
36	
36	After the glimpse I had had of the Martians emerging from the
36	cylinder in which they had come to the earth from their planet, a kind
36	of fascination paralysed my actions.  I remained standing knee-deep in
36	the heather, staring at the mound that hid them.  I was a battleground
36	of fear and curiosity.
36	
36	I did not dare to go back towards the pit, but I felt a passionate
36	longing to peer into it.  I began walking, therefore, in a big curve,
36	seeking some point of vantage and continually looking at the sand
36	heaps that hid these new-comers to our earth.  Once a leash of thin
36	black whips, like the arms of an octopus, flashed across the sunset
36	and was immediately withdrawn, and afterwards a thin rod rose up,
36	joint by joint, bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a
36	wobbling motion.  What could be going on there?
36	
36	Most of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups--one a
36	little crowd towards Woking, the other a knot of people in the
36	direction of Chobham.  Evidently they shared my mental conflict.
36	There were few near me.  One man I approached--he was, I perceived,
36	a neighbour of mine, though I did not know his name--and accosted.
36	But it was scarcely a time for articulate conversation.
36	
36	""What ugly _brutes_!"" he said.  ""Good God!  What ugly brutes!""  He
36	repeated this over and over again.
36	
36	""Did you see a man in the pit?"" I said; but he made no answer to
36	that.  We became silent, and stood watching for a time side by side,
36	deriving, I fancy, a certain comfort in one another's company.  Then I
36	shifted my position to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of a
36	yard or more of elevation and when I looked for him presently he was
36	walking towards Woking.
36	
36	The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened.  The
36	crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I
36	heard now a faint murmur from it.  The little knot of people towards
36	Chobham dispersed.  There was scarcely an intimation of movement from
36	the pit.
36	
36	It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I
36	suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore
36	confidence.  At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent
36	movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gather
36	force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained
36	unbroken.  Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance,
36	stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin
36	irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated
36	horns.  I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.
36	
36	Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand
36	pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels.  I saw a
36	lad trundling off the barrow of apples.  And then, within thirty yards
36	of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little
36	black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.
36	
36	This was the Deputation.  There had been a hasty consultation, and
36	since the Martians were evidently, in spite of their repulsive forms,
36	intelligent creatures, it had been resolved to show them, by
36	approaching them with signals, that we too were intelligent.
36	
36	Flutter, flutter, went the flag, first to the right, then to the
36	left.  It was too far for me to recognise anyone there, but afterwards
36	I learned that Ogilvy, Stent, and Henderson were with others in this
36	attempt at communication.  This little group had in its advance
36	dragged inward, so to speak, the circumference of the now almost
36	complete circle of people, and a number of dim black figures followed
36	it at discreet distances.
36	
36	Suddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminous
36	greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs, which
36	drove up, one after the other, straight into the still air.
36	
36	This smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word for it) was
36	so bright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of
36	brown common towards Chertsey, set with black pine trees, seemed to
36	darken abruptly as these puffs arose, and to remain the darker after
36	their dispersal.  At the same time a faint hissing sound became
36	audible.
36	
36	Beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag
36	at its apex, arrested by these phenomena, a little knot of small
36	vertical black shapes upon the black ground.  As the green smoke arose,
36	their faces flashed out pallid green, and faded again as it vanished.
36	Then slowly the hissing passed into a humming, into a long, loud,
36	droning noise.  Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit, and the
36	ghost of a beam of light seemed to flicker out from it.
36	
36	Forthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping from one
36	to another, sprang from the scattered group of men.  It was as if some
36	invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame.  It was
36	as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire.
36	
36	Then, by the light of their own destruction, I saw them staggering
36	and falling, and their supporters turning to run.
36	
36	I stood staring, not as yet realising that this was death leaping
36	from man to man in that little distant crowd.  All I felt was that it
36	was something very strange.  An almost noiseless and blinding flash of
36	light, and a man fell headlong and lay still; and as the unseen shaft
36	of heat passed over them, pine trees burst into fire, and every dry
36	furze bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames.  And far away
36	towards Knaphill I saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden
36	buildings suddenly set alight.
36	
36	It was sweeping round swiftly and steadily, this flaming death,
36	this invisible, inevitable sword of heat.  I perceived it coming
36	towards me by the flashing bushes it touched, and was too astounded
36	and stupefied to stir.  I heard the crackle of fire in the sand pits
36	and the sudden squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled.  Then
36	it was as if an invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn
36	through the heather between me and the Martians, and all along a
36	curving line beyond the sand pits the dark ground smoked and crackled.
36	Something fell with a crash far away to the left where the road from
36	Woking station opens out on the common.  Forth-with the hissing and
36	humming ceased, and the black, dome-like object sank slowly out of
36	sight into the pit.
36	
36	All this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood
36	motionless, dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light.  Had that
36	death swept through a full circle, it must inevitably have slain me in
36	my surprise.  But it passed and spared me, and left the night about me
36	suddenly dark and unfamiliar.
36	
36	The undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness, except
36	where its roadways lay grey and pale under the deep blue sky of the
36	early night.  It was dark, and suddenly void of men.  Overhead the
36	stars were mustering, and in the west the sky was still a pale,
36	bright, almost greenish blue.  The tops of the pine trees and the
36	roofs of Horsell came out sharp and black against the western
36	afterglow.  The Martians and their appliances were altogether
36	invisible, save for that thin mast upon which their restless mirror
36	wobbled.  Patches of bush and isolated trees here and there smoked and
36	glowed still, and the houses towards Woking station were sending up
36	spires of flame into the stillness of the evening air.
36	
36	Nothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonishment.  The
36	little group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept out
36	of existence, and the stillness of the evening, so it seemed to me,
36	had scarcely been broken.
36	
36	It came to me that I was upon this dark common, helpless,
36	unprotected, and alone.  Suddenly, like a thing falling upon me from
36	without, came--fear.
36	
36	With an effort I turned and began a stumbling run through the
36	heather.
36	
36	The fear I felt was no rational fear, but a panic terror not only
36	of the Martians, but of the dusk and stillness all about me.  Such an
36	extraordinary effect in unmanning me it had that I ran weeping
36	silently as a child might do.  Once I had turned, I did not dare to
36	look back.
36	
36	I remember I felt an extraordinary persuasion that I was being
36	played with, that presently, when I was upon the very verge of safety,
36	this mysterious death--as swift as the passage of light--would leap
36	after me from the pit about the cylinder and strike me down.
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER SIX
36	
36	THE HEAT-RAY IN THE CHOBHAM ROAD
36	
36	
36	It is still a matter of wonder how the Martians are able to slay
36	men so swiftly and so silently.  Many think that in some way they are
36	able to generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute
36	non-conductivity.  This intense heat they project in a parallel beam
36	against any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolic
36	mirror of unknown composition, much as the parabolic mirror of a
36	lighthouse projects a beam of light.  But no one has absolutely proved
36	these details.  However it is done, it is certain that a beam of heat
36	is the essence of the matter.  Heat, and invisible, instead of
36	visible, light.  Whatever is combustible flashes into flame at its
36	touch, lead runs like water, it softens iron, cracks and melts glass,
36	and when it falls upon water, incontinently that explodes into steam.
36	
36	That night nearly forty people lay under the starlight about the
36	pit, charred and distorted beyond recognition, and all night long the
36	common from Horsell to Maybury was deserted and brightly ablaze.
36	
36	The news of the massacre probably reached Chobham, Woking, and
36	Ottershaw about the same time.  In Woking the shops had closed when
36	the tragedy happened, and a number of people, shop people and so
36	forth, attracted by the stories they had heard, were walking over the
36	Horsell Bridge and along the road between the hedges that runs out at
36	last upon the common.  You may imagine the young people brushed up
36	after the labours of the day, and making this novelty, as they would
36	make any novelty, the excuse for walking together and enjoying a
36	trivial flirtation.  You may figure to yourself the hum of voices
36	along the road in the gloaming. . . .
36	
36	As yet, of course, few people in Woking even knew that the cylinder
36	had opened, though poor Henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle to
36	the post office with a special wire to an evening paper.
36	
36	As these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open, they
36	found little knots of people talking excitedly and peering at the
36	spinning mirror over the sand pits, and the newcomers were, no doubt,
36	soon infected by the excitement of the occasion.
36	
36	By half past eight, when the Deputation was destroyed, there may
36	have been a crowd of three hundred people or more at this place,
36	besides those who had left the road to approach the Martians nearer.
36	There were three policemen too, one of whom was mounted, doing their
36	best, under instructions from Stent, to keep the people back and deter
36	them from approaching the cylinder.  There was some booing from those
36	more thoughtless and excitable souls to whom a crowd is always an
36	occasion for noise and horse-play.
36	
36	Stent and Ogilvy, anticipating some possibilities of a collision,
36	had telegraphed from Horsell to the barracks as soon as the Martians
36	emerged, for the help of a company of soldiers to protect these
36	strange creatures from violence.  After that they returned to lead that
36	ill-fated advance.  The description of their death, as it was seen by
36	the crowd, tallies very closely with my own impressions: the three
36	puffs of green smoke, the deep humming note, and the flashes of flame.
36	
36	But that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than mine.  Only
36	the fact that a hummock of heathery sand intercepted the lower part of
36	the Heat-Ray saved them.  Had the elevation of the parabolic mirror
36	been a few yards higher, none could have lived to tell the tale.  They
36	saw the flashes and the men falling and an invisible hand, as it were,
36	lit the bushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight.  Then,
36	with a whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit, the beam
36	swung close over their heads, lighting the tops of the beech trees
36	that line the road, and splitting the bricks, smashing the windows,
36	firing the window frames, and bringing down in crumbling ruin a
36	portion of the gable of the house nearest the corner.
36	
36	In the sudden thud, hiss, and glare of the igniting trees, the
36	panic-stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly for some
36	moments.  Sparks and burning twigs began to fall into the road, and
36	single leaves like puffs of flame.  Hats and dresses caught fire.  Then
36	came a crying from the common.  There were shrieks and shouts, and
36	suddenly a mounted policeman came galloping through the confusion with
36	his hands clasped over his head, screaming.
36	
36	""They're coming!"" a woman shrieked, and incontinently everyone was
36	turning and pushing at those behind, in order to clear their way to
36	Woking again.  They must have bolted as blindly as a flock of sheep.
36	Where the road grows narrow and black between the high banks the crowd
36	jammed, and a desperate struggle occurred.  All that crowd did not
36	escape; three persons at least, two women and a little boy, were
36	crushed and trampled there, and left to die amid the terror and the
36	darkness.
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER SEVEN
36	
36	HOW I REACHED HOME
36	
36	
36	For my own part, I remember nothing of my flight except the stress
36	of blundering against trees and stumbling through the heather.  All
36	about me gathered the invisible terrors of the Martians; that pitiless
36	sword of heat seemed whirling to and fro, flourishing overhead before
36	it descended and smote me out of life.  I came into the road between
36	the crossroads and Horsell, and ran along this to the crossroads.
36	
36	At last I could go no further; I was exhausted with the violence of
36	my emotion and of my flight, and I staggered and fell by the wayside.
36	That was near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gasworks.  I
36	fell and lay still.
36	
36	I must have remained there some time.
36	
36	I sat up, strangely perplexed.  For a moment, perhaps, I could not
36	clearly understand how I came there.  My terror had fallen from me
36	like a garment.  My hat had gone, and my collar had burst away from
36	its fastener.  A few minutes before, there had only been three real
36	things before me--the immensity of the night and space and nature, my
36	own feebleness and anguish, and the near approach of death.  Now it
36	was as if something turned over, and the point of view altered
36	abruptly.  There was no sensible transition from one state of mind to
36	the other.  I was immediately the self of every day again--a decent,
36	ordinary citizen.  The silent common, the impulse of my flight, the
36	starting flames, were as if they had been in a dream.  I asked myself
36	had these latter things indeed happened?  I could not credit it.
36	
36	I rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge.  My
36	mind was blank wonder.  My muscles and nerves seemed drained of their
36	strength.  I dare say I staggered drunkenly.  A head rose over the
36	arch, and the figure of a workman carrying a basket appeared.  Beside
36	him ran a little boy.  He passed me, wishing me good night.  I was
36	minded to speak to him, but did not.  I answered his greeting with a
36	meaningless mumble and went on over the bridge.
36	
36	Over the Maybury arch a train, a billowing tumult of white, firelit
36	smoke, and a long caterpillar of lighted windows, went flying
36	south--clatter, clatter, clap, rap, and it had gone.  A dim group of
36	people talked in the gate of one of the houses in the pretty little
36	row of gables that was called Oriental Terrace.  It was all so real
36	and so familiar.  And that behind me!  It was frantic, fantastic!
36	Such things, I told myself, could not be.
36	
36	Perhaps I am a man of exceptional moods.  I do not know how far my
36	experience is common.  At times I suffer from the strangest sense of
36	detachment from myself and the world about me; I seem to watch it all
36	from the outside, from somewhere inconceivably remote, out of time,
36	out of space, out of the stress and tragedy of it all.  This feeling
36	was very strong upon me that night.  Here was another side to my
36	dream.
36	
36	But the trouble was the blank incongruity of this serenity and the
36	swift death flying yonder, not two miles away.  There was a noise of
36	business from the gasworks, and the electric lamps were all alight.  I
36	stopped at the group of people.
36	
36	""What news from the common?"" said I.
36	
36	There were two men and a woman at the gate.
36	
36	""Eh?"" said one of the men, turning.
36	
36	""What news from the common?"" I said.
36	
36	""'Ain't yer just _been_ there?"" asked the men.
36	
36	""People seem fair silly about the common,"" said the woman over the
36	gate.  ""What's it all abart?""
36	
36	""Haven't you heard of the men from Mars?"" said I; ""the creatures
36	from Mars?""
36	
36	""Quite enough,"" said the woman over the gate.  ""Thenks""; and all
36	three of them laughed.
36	
36	I felt foolish and angry.  I tried and found I could not tell them
36	what I had seen.  They laughed again at my broken sentences.
36	
36	""You'll hear more yet,"" I said, and went on to my home.
36	
36	I startled my wife at the doorway, so haggard was I.  I went into
36	the dining room, sat down, drank some wine, and so soon as I could
36	collect myself sufficiently I told her the things I had seen.  The
36	dinner, which was a cold one, had already been served, and remained
36	neglected on the table while I told my story.
36	
36	""There is one thing,"" I said, to allay the fears I had aroused;
36	""they are the most sluggish things I ever saw crawl.  They may keep
36	the pit and kill people who come near them, but they cannot get out
36	of it. . . .  But the horror of them!""
36	
36	""Don't, dear!"" said my wife, knitting her brows and putting her
36	hand on mine.
36	
36	""Poor Ogilvy!"" I said.  ""To think he may be lying dead there!""
36	
36	My wife at least did not find my experience incredible.  When I saw
36	how deadly white her face was, I ceased abruptly.
36	
36	""They may come here,"" she said again and again.
36	
36	I pressed her to take wine, and tried to reassure her.
36	
36	""They can scarcely move,"" I said.
36	
36	I began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that Ogilvy had
36	told me of the impossibility of the Martians establishing themselves
36	on the earth.  In particular I laid stress on the gravitational
36	difficulty.  On the surface of the earth the force of gravity is three
36	times what it is on the surface of Mars.  A Martian, therefore, would
36	weigh three times more than on Mars, albeit his muscular strength
36	would be the same.  His own body would be a cope of lead to him.  That,
36	indeed, was the general opinion.  Both _The Times_ and the _Daily
36	Telegraph_, for instance, insisted on it the next morning, and both
36	overlooked, just as I did, two obvious modifying influences.
36	
36	The atmosphere of the earth, we now know, contains far more oxygen
36	or far less argon (whichever way one likes to put it) than does Mars.
36	The invigorating influences of this excess of oxygen upon the Martians
36	indisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of their
36	bodies.  And, in the second place, we all overlooked the fact that
36	such mechanical intelligence as the Martian possessed was quite able
36	to dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch.
36	
36	But I did not consider these points at the time, and so my
36	reasoning was dead against the chances of the invaders.  With wine and
36	food, the confidence of my own table, and the necessity of reassuring
36	my wife, I grew by insensible degrees courageous and secure.
36	
36	""They have done a foolish thing,"" said I, fingering my wineglass.
36	""They are dangerous because, no doubt, they are mad with terror.
36	Perhaps they expected to find no living things--certainly no
36	intelligent living things.""
36	
36	""A shell in the pit"" said I, ""if the worst comes to the worst will
36	kill them all.""
36	
36	The intense excitement of the events had no doubt left my
36	perceptive powers in a state of erethism.  I remember that dinner
36	table with extraordinary vividness even now.  My dear wife's sweet
36	anxious face peering at me from under the pink lamp shade, the white
36	cloth with its silver and glass table furniture--for in those days
36	even philosophical writers had many little luxuries--the crimson-purple
36	wine in my glass, are photographically distinct.  At the end of
36	it I sat, tempering nuts with a cigarette, regretting Ogilvy's
36	rashness, and denouncing the shortsighted timidity of the Martians.
36	
36	So some respectable dodo in the Mauritius might have lorded it in
36	his nest, and discussed the arrival of that shipful of pitiless
36	sailors in want of animal food.  ""We will peck them to death tomorrow,
36	my dear.""
36	
36	I did not know it, but that was the last civilised dinner I was to
36	eat for very many strange and terrible days.
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER EIGHT
36	
36	FRIDAY NIGHT
36	
36	
36	The most extraordinary thing to my mind, of all the strange and
36	wonderful things that happened upon that Friday, was the dovetailing
36	of the commonplace habits of our social order with the first
36	beginnings of the series of events that was to topple that social
36	order headlong.  If on Friday night you had taken a pair of compasses
36	and drawn a circle with a radius of five miles round the Woking sand
36	pits, I doubt if you would have had one human being outside it, unless
36	it were some relation of Stent or of the three or four cyclists or
36	London people lying dead on the common, whose emotions or habits were
36	at all affected by the new-comers.  Many people had heard of the
36	cylinder, of course, and talked about it in their leisure, but it
36	certainly did not make the sensation that an ultimatum to Germany
36	would have done.
36	
36	In London that night poor Henderson's telegram describing the
36	gradual unscrewing of the shot was judged to be a canard, and his
36	evening paper, after wiring for authentication from him and receiving
36	no reply--the man was killed--decided not to print a special edition.
36	
36	Even within the five-mile circle the great majority of people were
36	inert.  I have already described the behaviour of the men and women to
36	whom I spoke.  All over the district people were dining and supping;
36	working men were gardening after the labours of the day, children
36	were being put to bed, young people were wandering through the lanes
36	love-making, students sat over their books.
36	
36	Maybe there was a murmur in the village streets, a novel and
36	dominant topic in the public-houses, and here and there a messenger,
36	or even an eye-witness of the later occurrences, caused a whirl of
36	excitement, a shouting, and a running to and fro; but for the most
36	part the daily routine of working, eating, drinking, sleeping, went on
36	as it had done for countless years--as though no planet Mars existed
36	in the sky.  Even at Woking station and Horsell and Chobham that was
36	the case.
36	
36	In Woking junction, until a late hour, trains were stopping and
36	going on, others were shunting on the sidings, passengers were
36	alighting and waiting, and everything was proceeding in the most
36	ordinary way.  A boy from the town, trenching on Smith's monopoly, was
36	selling papers with the afternoon's news.  The ringing impact of
36	trucks, the sharp whistle of the engines from the junction, mingled
36	with their shouts of ""Men from Mars!""  Excited men came into the
36	station about nine o'clock with incredible tidings, and caused no more
36	disturbance than drunkards might have done.  People rattling
36	Londonwards peered into the darkness outside the carriage windows, and
36	saw only a rare, flickering, vanishing spark dance up from the
36	direction of Horsell, a red glow and a thin veil of smoke driving
36	across the stars, and thought that nothing more serious than a heath
36	fire was happening.  It was only round the edge of the common that any
36	disturbance was perceptible.  There were half a dozen villas burning
36	on the Woking border.  There were lights in all the houses on the
36	common side of the three villages, and the people there kept awake
36	till dawn.
36	
36	A curious crowd lingered restlessly, people coming and going but
36	the crowd remaining, both on the Chobham and Horsell bridges.  One or
36	two adventurous souls, it was afterwards found, went into the darkness
36	and crawled quite near the Martians; but they never returned, for now
36	and again a light-ray, like the beam of a warship's searchlight swept
36	the common, and the Heat-Ray was ready to follow.  Save for such, that
36	big area of common was silent and desolate, and the charred bodies lay
36	about on it all night under the stars, and all the next day.  A noise
36	of hammering from the pit was heard by many people.
36	
36	So you have the state of things on Friday night.  In the centre,
36	sticking into the skin of our old planet Earth like a poisoned dart,
36	was this cylinder.  But the poison was scarcely working yet.  Around
36	it was a patch of silent common, smouldering in places, and with a few
36	dark, dimly seen objects lying in contorted attitudes here and there.
36	Here and there was a burning bush or tree.  Beyond was a fringe of
36	excitement, and farther than that fringe the inflammation had not
36	crept as yet.  In the rest of the world the stream of life still
36	flowed as it had flowed for immemorial years.  The fever of war that
36	would presently clog vein and artery, deaden nerve and destroy brain,
36	had still to develop.
36	
36	All night long the Martians were hammering and stirring, sleepless,
36	indefatigable, at work upon the machines they were making ready, and
36	ever and again a puff of greenish-white smoke whirled up to the
36	starlit sky.
36	
36	About eleven a company of soldiers came through Horsell, and
36	deployed along the edge of the common to form a cordon.  Later a
36	second company marched through Chobham to deploy on the north side of
36	the common.  Several officers from the Inkerman barracks had been on
36	the common earlier in the day, and one, Major Eden, was reported to be
36	missing.  The colonel of the regiment came to the Chobham bridge and
36	was busy questioning the crowd at midnight.  The military authorities
36	were certainly alive to the seriousness of the business.  About
36	eleven, the next morning's papers were able to say, a squadron of
36	hussars, two Maxims, and about four hundred men of the Cardigan
36	regiment started from Aldershot.
36	
36	A few seconds after midnight the crowd in the Chertsey road,
36	Woking, saw a star fall from heaven into the pine woods to the
36	northwest.  It had a greenish colour, and caused a silent brightness
36	like summer lightning.  This was the second cylinder.
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER NINE
36	
36	THE FIGHTING BEGINS
36	
36	
36	Saturday lives in my memory as a day of suspense.  It was a day of
36	lassitude too, hot and close, with, I am told, a rapidly fluctuating
36	barometer.  I had slept but little, though my wife had succeeded in
36	sleeping, and I rose early.  I went into my garden before breakfast
36	and stood listening, but towards the common there was nothing stirring
36	but a lark.
36	
36	The milkman came as usual.  I heard the rattle of his chariot and I
36	went round to the side gate to ask the latest news.  He told me that
36	during the night the Martians had been surrounded by troops, and that
36	guns were expected.  Then--a familiar, reassuring note--I heard a train
36	running towards Woking.
36	
36	""They aren't to be killed,"" said the milkman, ""if that can possibly
36	be avoided.""
36	
36	I saw my neighbour gardening, chatted with him for a time, and then
36	strolled in to breakfast.  It was a most unexceptional morning.  My
36	neighbour was of opinion that the troops would be able to capture or
36	to destroy the Martians during the day.
36	
36	""It's a pity they make themselves so unapproachable,"" he said.  ""It
36	would be curious to know how they live on another planet; we might
36	learn a thing or two.""
36	
36	He came up to the fence and extended a handful of strawberries, for
36	his gardening was as generous as it was enthusiastic.  At the same
36	time he told me of the burning of the pine woods about the Byfleet
36	Golf Links.
36	
36	""They say,"" said he, ""that there's another of those blessed things
36	fallen there--number two.  But one's enough, surely.  This lot'll cost
36	the insurance people a pretty penny before everything's settled.""  He
36	laughed with an air of the greatest good humour as he said this.  The
36	woods, he said, were still burning, and pointed out a haze of smoke to
36	me.  ""They will be hot under foot for days, on account of the thick
36	soil of pine needles and turf,"" he said, and then grew serious over
36	""poor Ogilvy.""
36	
36	After breakfast, instead of working, I decided to walk down
36	towards the common.  Under the railway bridge I found a group of
36	soldiers--sappers, I think, men in small round caps, dirty red jackets
36	unbuttoned, and showing their blue shirts, dark trousers, and boots
36	coming to the calf.  They told me no one was allowed over the canal,
36	and, looking along the road towards the bridge, I saw one of the
36	Cardigan men standing sentinel there.  I talked with these soldiers
36	for a time; I told them of my sight of the Martians on the previous
36	evening.  None of them had seen the Martians, and they had but the
36	vaguest ideas of them, so that they plied me with questions.  They
36	said that they did not know who had authorised the movements of the
36	troops; their idea was that a dispute had arisen at the Horse Guards.
36	The ordinary sapper is a great deal better educated than the common
36	soldier, and they discussed the peculiar conditions of the possible
36	fight with some acuteness.  I described the Heat-Ray to them, and they
36	began to argue among themselves.
36	
36	""Crawl up under cover and rush 'em, say I,"" said one.
36	
36	""Get aht!"" said another.  ""What's cover against this 'ere 'eat?
36	Sticks to cook yer!  What we got to do is to go as near as the
36	ground'll let us, and then drive a trench.""
36	
36	""Blow yer trenches!  You always want trenches; you ought to ha'
36	been born a rabbit Snippy.""
36	
36	""Ain't they got any necks, then?"" said a third, abruptly--a little,
36	contemplative, dark man, smoking a pipe.
36	
36	I repeated my description.
36	
36	""Octopuses,"" said he, ""that's what I calls 'em.  Talk about fishers
36	of men--fighters of fish it is this time!""
36	
36	""It ain't no murder killing beasts like that,"" said the first
36	speaker.
36	
36	""Why not shell the darned things strite off and finish 'em?"" said
36	the little dark man.  ""You carn tell what they might do.""
36	
36	""Where's your shells?"" said the first speaker.  ""There ain't no
36	time.  Do it in a rush, that's my tip, and do it at once.""
36	
36	So they discussed it.  After a while I left them, and went on to
36	the railway station to get as many morning papers as I could.
36	
36	But I will not weary the reader with a description of that long
36	morning and of the longer afternoon.  I did not succeed in getting a
36	glimpse of the common, for even Horsell and Chobham church towers were
36	in the hands of the military authorities.  The soldiers I addressed
36	didn't know anything; the officers were mysterious as well as busy.  I
36	found people in the town quite secure again in the presence of the
36	military, and I heard for the first time from Marshall, the
36	tobacconist, that his son was among the dead on the common.  The
36	soldiers had made the people on the outskirts of Horsell lock up and
36	leave their houses.
36	
36	I got back to lunch about two, very tired for, as I have said, the
36	day was extremely hot and dull; and in order to refresh myself I took
36	a cold bath in the afternoon.  About half past four I went up to the
36	railway station to get an evening paper, for the morning papers had
36	contained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of Stent,
36	Henderson, Ogilvy, and the others.  But there was little I didn't
36	know.  The Martians did not show an inch of themselves.  They seemed
36	busy in their pit, and there was a sound of hammering and an almost
36	continuous streamer of smoke.  Apparently they were busy getting ready
36	for a struggle.  ""Fresh attempts have been made to signal, but without
36	success,"" was the stereotyped formula of the papers.  A sapper told me
36	it was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole.  The
36	Martians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the
36	lowing of a cow.
36	
36	I must confess the sight of all this armament, all this
36	preparation, greatly excited me.  My imagination became belligerent,
36	and defeated the invaders in a dozen striking ways; something of my
36	schoolboy dreams of battle and heroism came back.  It hardly seemed a
36	fair fight to me at that time.  They seemed very helpless in that pit
36	of theirs.
36	
36	About three o'clock there began the thud of a gun at measured
36	intervals from Chertsey or Addlestone.  I learned that the smouldering
36	pine wood into which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled,
36	in the hope of destroying that object before it opened.  It was only
36	about five, however, that a field gun reached Chobham for use against
36	the first body of Martians.
36	
36	About six in the evening, as I sat at tea with my wife in the
36	summerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon
36	us, I heard a muffled detonation from the common, and immediately
36	after a gust of firing.  Close on the heels of that came a violent
36	rattling crash, quite close to us, that shook the ground; and,
36	starting out upon the lawn, I saw the tops of the trees about the
36	Oriental College burst into smoky red flame, and the tower of the
36	little church beside it slide down into ruin.  The pinnacle of the
36	mosque had vanished, and the roof line of the college itself looked as
36	if a hundred-ton gun had been at work upon it.  One of our chimneys
36	cracked as if a shot had hit it, flew, and a piece of it came
36	clattering down the tiles and made a heap of broken red fragments upon
36	the flower bed by my study window.
36	
36	I and my wife stood amazed.  Then I realised that the crest of
36	Maybury Hill must be within range of the Martians' Heat-Ray now that
36	the college was cleared out of the way.
36	
36	At that I gripped my wife's arm, and without ceremony ran her out
36	into the road.  Then I fetched out the servant, telling her I would go
36	upstairs myself for the box she was clamouring for.
36	
36	""We can't possibly stay here,"" I said; and as I spoke the firing
36	reopened for a moment upon the common.
36	
36	""But where are we to go?"" said my wife in terror.
36	
36	I thought perplexed.  Then I remembered her cousins at Leatherhead.
36	
36	""Leatherhead!"" I shouted above the sudden noise.
36	
36	She looked away from me downhill.  The people were coming out of
36	their houses, astonished.
36	
36	""How are we to get to Leatherhead?"" she said.
36	
36	Down the hill I saw a bevy of hussars ride under the railway
36	bridge; three galloped through the open gates of the Oriental College;
36	two others dismounted, and began running from house to house.  The
36	sun, shining through the smoke that drove up from the tops of the
36	trees, seemed blood red, and threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon
36	everything.
36	
36	""Stop here,"" said I; ""you are safe here""; and I started off at once
36	for the Spotted Dog, for I knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart.
36	I ran, for I perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the
36	hill would be moving.  I found him in his bar, quite unaware of what
36	was going on behind his house.  A man stood with his back to me,
36	talking to him.
36	
36	""I must have a pound,"" said the landlord, ""and I've no one to drive
36	it.""
36	
36	""I'll give you two,"" said I, over the stranger's shoulder.
36	
36	""What for?""
36	
36	""And I'll bring it back by midnight,"" I said.
36	
36	""Lord!"" said the landlord; ""what's the hurry?  I'm selling my bit
36	of a pig.  Two pounds, and you bring it back?  What's going on now?""
36	
36	I explained hastily that I had to leave my home, and so secured the
36	dog cart.  At the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the
36	landlord should leave his.  I took care to have the cart there and
36	then, drove it off down the road, and, leaving it in charge of my wife
36	and servant, rushed into my house and packed a few valuables, such
36	plate as we had, and so forth.  The beech trees below the house were
36	burning while I did this, and the palings up the road glowed red.
36	While I was occupied in this way, one of the dismounted hussars came
36	running up.  He was going from house to house, warning people to
36	leave.  He was going on as I came out of my front door, lugging my
36	treasures, done up in a tablecloth.  I shouted after him:
36	
36	""What news?""
36	
36	He turned, stared, bawled something about ""crawling out in a thing
36	like a dish cover,"" and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest.
36	A sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a
36	moment.  I ran to my neighbour's door and rapped to satisfy myself of
36	what I already knew, that his wife had gone to London with him and had
36	locked up their house.  I went in again, according to my promise, to
36	get my servant's box, lugged it out, clapped it beside her on the tail
36	of the dog cart, and then caught the reins and jumped up into the
36	driver's seat beside my wife.  In another moment we were clear of the
36	smoke and noise, and spanking down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill
36	towards Old Woking.
36	
36	In front was a quiet sunny landscape, a wheat field ahead on either
36	side of the road, and the Maybury Inn with its swinging sign.  I saw
36	the doctor's cart ahead of me.  At the bottom of the hill I turned my
36	head to look at the hillside I was leaving.  Thick streamers of black
36	smoke shot with threads of red fire were driving up into the still
36	air, and throwing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward.  The
36	smoke already extended far away to the east and west--to the Byfleet
36	pine woods eastward, and to Woking on the west.  The road was dotted
36	with people running towards us.  And very faint now, but very distinct
36	through the hot, quiet air, one heard the whirr of a machine-gun that
36	was presently stilled, and an intermittent cracking of rifles.
36	Apparently the Martians were setting fire to everything within range
36	of their Heat-Ray.
36	
36	I am not an expert driver, and I had immediately to turn my
36	attention to the horse.  When I looked back again the second hill had
36	hidden the black smoke.  I slashed the horse with the whip, and gave
36	him a loose rein until Woking and Send lay between us and that
36	quivering tumult.  I overtook and passed the doctor between Woking and
36	Send.
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER TEN
36	
36	IN THE STORM
36	
36	
36	Leatherhead is about twelve miles from Maybury Hill.  The scent of
36	hay was in the air through the lush meadows beyond Pyrford, and the
36	hedges on either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses.
36	The heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down
36	Maybury Hill ceased as abruptly as it began, leaving the evening very
36	peaceful and still.  We got to Leatherhead without misadventure about
36	nine o'clock, and the horse had an hour's rest while I took supper
36	with my cousins and commended my wife to their care.
36	
36	My wife was curiously silent throughout the drive, and seemed
36	oppressed with forebodings of evil.  I talked to her reassuringly,
36	pointing out that the Martians were tied to the Pit by sheer
36	heaviness, and at the utmost could but crawl a little out of it; but
36	she answered only in monosyllables.  Had it not been for my promise to
36	the innkeeper, she would, I think, have urged me to stay in
36	Leatherhead that night.  Would that I had!  Her face, I remember, was
36	very white as we parted.
36	
36	For my own part, I had been feverishly excited all day.  Something
36	very like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised
36	community had got into my blood, and in my heart I was not so very
36	sorry that I had to return to Maybury that night.  I was even afraid
36	that that last fusillade I had heard might mean the extermination of
36	our invaders from Mars.  I can best express my state of mind by saying
36	that I wanted to be in at the death.
36	
36	It was nearly eleven when I started to return.  The night was
36	unexpectedly dark; to me, walking out of the lighted passage of my
36	cousins' house, it seemed indeed black, and it was as hot and close as
36	the day.  Overhead the clouds were driving fast, albeit not a breath
36	stirred the shrubs about us.  My cousins' man lit both lamps.  Happily,
36	I knew the road intimately.  My wife stood in the light of the
36	doorway, and watched me until I jumped up into the dog cart.  Then
36	abruptly she turned and went in, leaving my cousins side by side
36	wishing me good hap.
36	
36	I was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my wife's
36	fears, but very soon my thoughts reverted to the Martians.  At that
36	time I was absolutely in the dark as to the course of the evening's
36	fighting.  I did not know even the circumstances that had precipitated
36	the conflict.  As I came through Ockham (for that was the way I
36	returned, and not through Send and Old Woking) I saw along the western
36	horizon a blood-red glow, which as I drew nearer, crept slowly up the
36	sky.  The driving clouds of the gathering thunderstorm mingled there
36	with masses of black and red smoke.
36	
36	Ripley Street was deserted, and except for a lighted window or so
36	the village showed not a sign of life; but I narrowly escaped an
36	accident at the corner of the road to Pyrford, where a knot of people
36	stood with their backs to me.  They said nothing to me as I passed.  I
36	do not know what they knew of the things happening beyond the hill,
36	nor do I know if the silent houses I passed on my way were sleeping
36	securely, or deserted and empty, or harassed and watching against the
36	terror of the night.
36	
36	From Ripley until I came through Pyrford I was in the valley of the
36	Wey, and the red glare was hidden from me.  As I ascended the little
36	hill beyond Pyrford Church the glare came into view again, and the
36	trees about me shivered with the first intimation of the storm that
36	was upon me.  Then I heard midnight pealing out from Pyrford Church
36	behind me, and then came the silhouette of Maybury Hill, with its
36	tree-tops and roofs black and sharp against the red.
36	
36	Even as I beheld this a lurid green glare lit the road about me and
36	showed the distant woods towards Addlestone.  I felt a tug at the
36	reins.  I saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as it were by a
36	thread of green fire, suddenly lighting their confusion and falling
36	into the field to my left.  It was the third falling star!
36	
36	Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast, danced
36	out the first lightning of the gathering storm, and the thunder burst
36	like a rocket overhead.  The horse took the bit between his teeth and
36	bolted.
36	
36	A moderate incline runs towards the foot of Maybury Hill, and down
36	this we clattered.  Once the lightning had begun, it went on in as
36	rapid a succession of flashes as I have ever seen.  The thunderclaps,
36	treading one on the heels of another and with a strange crackling
36	accompaniment, sounded more like the working of a gigantic electric
36	machine than the usual detonating reverberations.  The flickering
36	light was blinding and confusing, and a thin hail smote gustily at my
36	face as I drove down the slope.
36	
36	At first I regarded little but the road before me, and then
36	abruptly my attention was arrested by something that was moving
36	rapidly down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill.  At first I took it
36	for the wet roof of a house, but one flash following another showed it
36	to be in swift rolling movement.  It was an elusive vision--a moment
36	of bewildering darkness, and then, in a flash like daylight, the red
36	masses of the Orphanage near the crest of the hill, the green tops of
36	the pine trees, and this problematical object came out clear and sharp
36	and bright.
36	
36	And this Thing I saw!  How can I describe it?  A monstrous tripod,
36	higher than many houses, striding over the young pine trees, and
36	smashing them aside in its career; a walking engine of glittering
36	metal, striding now across the heather; articulate ropes of steel
36	dangling from it, and the clattering tumult of its passage mingling
36	with the riot of the thunder.  A flash, and it came out vividly,
36	heeling over one way with two feet in the air, to vanish and reappear
36	almost instantly as it seemed, with the next flash, a hundred yards
36	nearer.  Can you imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently
36	along the ground?  That was the impression those instant flashes gave.
36	But instead of a milking stool imagine it a great body of machinery on
36	a tripod stand.
36	
36	Then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted,
36	as brittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting through them; they were
36	snapped off and driven headlong, and a second huge tripod appeared,
36	rushing, as it seemed, headlong towards me.  And I was galloping hard
36	to meet it! At the sight of the second monster my nerve went
36	altogether.  Not stopping to look again, I wrenched the horse's head
36	hard round to the right and in another moment the dog cart had heeled
36	over upon the horse; the shafts smashed noisily, and I was flung
36	sideways and fell heavily into a shallow pool of water.
36	
36	I crawled out almost immediately, and crouched, my feet still in
36	the water, under a clump of furze.  The horse lay motionless (his neck
36	was broken, poor brute!) and by the lightning flashes I saw the black
36	bulk of the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still
36	spinning slowly.  In another moment the colossal mechanism went
36	striding by me, and passed uphill towards Pyrford.
36	
36	Seen nearer, the Thing was incredibly strange, for it was no mere
36	insensate machine driving on its way.  Machine it was, with a ringing
36	metallic pace, and long, flexible, glittering tentacles (one of which
36	gripped a young pine tree) swinging and rattling about its strange
36	body.  It picked its road as it went striding along, and the brazen
36	hood that surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable
36	suggestion of a head looking about.  Behind the main body was a huge
36	mass of white metal like a gigantic fisherman's basket, and puffs of
36	green smoke squirted out from the joints of the limbs as the monster
36	swept by me.  And in an instant it was gone.
36	
36	So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flickering of the
36	lightning, in blinding highlights and dense black shadows.
36	
36	As it passed it set up an exultant deafening howl that drowned the
36	thunder--""Aloo!  Aloo!""--and in another minute it was with its
36	companion, half a mile away, stooping over something in the field.  I
36	have no doubt this Thing in the field was the third of the ten
36	cylinders they had fired at us from Mars.
36	
36	For some minutes I lay there in the rain and darkness watching, by
36	the intermittent light, these monstrous beings of metal moving about
36	in the distance over the hedge tops.  A thin hail was now beginning,
36	and as it came and went their figures grew misty and then flashed into
36	clearness again.  Now and then came a gap in the lightning, and the
36	night swallowed them up.
36	
36	I was soaked with hail above and puddle water below.  It was some
36	time before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to
36	a drier position, or think at all of my imminent peril.
36	
36	Not far from me was a little one-roomed squatter's hut of wood,
36	surrounded by a patch of potato garden.  I struggled to my feet at
36	last, and, crouching and making use of every chance of cover, I made a
36	run for this.  I hammered at the door, but I could not make the people
36	hear (if there were any people inside), and after a time I desisted,
36	and, availing myself of a ditch for the greater part of the way,
36	succeeded in crawling, unobserved by these monstrous machines, into
36	the pine woods towards Maybury.
36	
36	Under cover of this I pushed on, wet and shivering now, towards my
36	own house.  I walked among the trees trying to find the footpath.  It
36	was very dark indeed in the wood, for the lightning was now becoming
36	infrequent, and the hail, which was pouring down in a torrent, fell in
36	columns through the gaps in the heavy foliage.
36	
36	If I had fully realised the meaning of all the things I had seen I
36	should have immediately worked my way round through Byfleet to Street
36	Cobham, and so gone back to rejoin my wife at Leatherhead.  But that
36	night the strangeness of things about me, and my physical
36	wretchedness, prevented me, for I was bruised, weary, wet to the skin,
36	deafened and blinded by the storm.
36	
36	I had a vague idea of going on to my own house, and that was as
36	much motive as I had.  I staggered through the trees, fell into a
36	ditch and bruised my knees against a plank, and finally splashed out
36	into the lane that ran down from the College Arms.  I say splashed,
36	for the storm water was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy
36	torrent.  There in the darkness a man blundered into me and sent me
36	reeling back.
36	
36	He gave a cry of terror, sprang sideways, and rushed on before I
36	could gather my wits sufficiently to speak to him.  So heavy was the
36	stress of the storm just at this place that I had the hardest task to
36	win my way up the hill.  I went close up to the fence on the left and
36	worked my way along its palings.
36	
36	Near the top I stumbled upon something soft, and, by a flash of
36	lightning, saw between my feet a heap of black broadcloth and a pair
36	of boots.  Before I could distinguish clearly how the man lay, the
36	flicker of light had passed.  I stood over him waiting for the next
36	flash.  When it came, I saw that he was a sturdy man, cheaply but not
36	shabbily dressed; his head was bent under his body, and he lay
36	crumpled up close to the fence, as though he had been flung violently
36	against it.
36	
36	Overcoming the repugnance natural to one who had never before
36	touched a dead body, I stooped and turned him over to feel for his
36	heart.  He was quite dead.  Apparently his neck had been broken.  The
36	lightning flashed for a third time, and his face leaped upon me.  I
36	sprang to my feet.  It was the landlord of the Spotted Dog, whose
36	conveyance I had taken.
36	
36	I stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up the hill.  I made my
36	way by the police station and the College Arms towards my own house.
36	Nothing was burning on the hillside, though from the common there
36	still came a red glare and a rolling tumult of ruddy smoke beating up
36	against the drenching hail.  So far as I could see by the flashes, the
36	houses about me were mostly uninjured.  By the College Arms a dark
36	heap lay in the road.
36	
36	Down the road towards Maybury Bridge there were voices and the
36	sound of feet, but I had not the courage to shout or to go to them.  I
36	let myself in with my latchkey, closed, locked and bolted the door,
36	staggered to the foot of the staircase, and sat down.  My imagination
36	was full of those striding metallic monsters, and of the dead body
36	smashed against the fence.
36	
36	I crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall,
36	shivering violently.
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER ELEVEN
36	
36	AT THE WINDOW
36	
36	
36	I have already said that my storms of emotion have a trick of
36	exhausting themselves.  After a time I discovered that I was cold and
36	wet, and with little pools of water about me on the stair carpet.  I
36	got up almost mechanically, went into the dining room and drank some
36	whiskey, and then I was moved to change my clothes.
36	
36	After I had done that I went upstairs to my study, but why I did so
36	I do not know.  The window of my study looks over the trees and the
36	railway towards Horsell Common.  In the hurry of our departure this
36	window had been left open.  The passage was dark, and, by contrast with
36	the picture the window frame enclosed, the side of the room seemed
36	impenetrably dark.  I stopped short in the doorway.
36	
36	The thunderstorm had passed.  The towers of the Oriental College
36	and the pine trees about it had gone, and very far away, lit by a
36	vivid red glare, the common about the sand pits was visible.  Across
36	the light huge black shapes, grotesque and strange, moved busily to
36	and fro.
36	
36	It seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction was on
36	fire--a broad hillside set with minute tongues of flame, swaying and
36	writhing with the gusts of the dying storm, and throwing a red
36	reflection upon the cloud-scud above.  Every now and then a haze of
36	smoke from some nearer conflagration drove across the window and hid
36	the Martian shapes.  I could not see what they were doing, nor the
36	clear form of them, nor recognise the black objects they were busied
36	upon.  Neither could I see the nearer fire, though the reflections of
36	it danced on the wall and ceiling of the study.  A sharp, resinous
36	tang of burning was in the air.
36	
36	I closed the door noiselessly and crept towards the window.  As I
36	did so, the view opened out until, on the one hand, it reached to the
36	houses about Woking station, and on the other to the charred and
36	blackened pine woods of Byfleet.  There was a light down below the
36	hill, on the railway, near the arch, and several of the houses along
36	the Maybury road and the streets near the station were glowing ruins.
36	The light upon the railway puzzled me at first; there were a black
36	heap and a vivid glare, and to the right of that a row of yellow
36	oblongs.  Then I perceived this was a wrecked train, the fore part
36	smashed and on fire, the hinder carriages still upon the rails.
36	
36	Between these three main centres of light--the houses, the train,
36	and the burning county towards Chobham--stretched irregular patches of
36	dark country, broken here and there by intervals of dimly glowing and
36	smoking ground.  It was the strangest spectacle, that black expanse set
36	with fire.  It reminded me, more than anything else, of the Potteries
36	at night.  At first I could distinguish no people at all, though I
36	peered intently for them.  Later I saw against the light of Woking
36	station a number of black figures hurrying one after the other across
36	the line.
36	
36	And this was the little world in which I had been living securely
36	for years, this fiery chaos!  What had happened in the last seven
36	hours I still did not know; nor did I know, though I was beginning to
36	guess, the relation between these mechanical colossi and the sluggish
36	lumps I had seen disgorged from the cylinder.  With a queer feeling of
36	impersonal interest I turned my desk chair to the window, sat down,
36	and stared at the blackened country, and particularly at the three
36	gigantic black things that were going to and fro in the glare about
36	the sand pits.
36	
36	They seemed amazingly busy.  I began to ask myself what they could
36	be.  Were they intelligent mechanisms?  Such a thing I felt was
36	impossible.  Or did a Martian sit within each, ruling, directing,
36	using, much as a man's brain sits and rules in his body?  I began to
36	compare the things to human machines, to ask myself for the first time
36	in my life how an ironclad or a steam engine would seem to an
36	intelligent lower animal.
36	
36	The storm had left the sky clear, and over the smoke of the burning
36	land the little fading pinpoint of Mars was dropping into the west,
36	when a soldier came into my garden.  I heard a slight scraping at the
36	fence, and rousing myself from the lethargy that had fallen upon me, I
36	looked down and saw him dimly, clambering over the palings.  At the
36	sight of another human being my torpor passed, and I leaned out of the
36	window eagerly.
36	
36	""Hist!"" said I, in a whisper.
36	
36	He stopped astride of the fence in doubt.  Then he came over and
36	across the lawn to the corner of the house.  He bent down and stepped
36	softly.
36	
36	""Who's there?"" he said, also whispering, standing under the window
36	and peering up.
36	
36	""Where are you going?"" I asked.
36	
36	""God knows.""
36	
36	""Are you trying to hide?""
36	
36	""That's it.""
36	
36	""Come into the house,"" I said.
36	
36	I went down, unfastened the door, and let him in, and locked the
36	door again.  I could not see his face.  He was hatless, and his coat
36	was unbuttoned.
36	
36	""My God!"" he said, as I drew him in.
36	
36	""What has happened?"" I asked.
36	
36	""What hasn't?""  In the obscurity I could see he made a gesture of
36	despair.  ""They wiped us out--simply wiped us out,"" he repeated again
36	and again.
36	
36	He followed me, almost mechanically, into the dining room.
36	
36	""Take some whiskey,"" I said, pouring out a stiff dose.
36	
36	He drank it.  Then abruptly he sat down before the table, put his
36	head on his arms, and began to sob and weep like a little boy, in a
36	perfect passion of emotion, while I, with a curious forgetfulness of
36	my own recent despair, stood beside him, wondering.
36	
36	It was a long time before he could steady his nerves to answer my
36	questions, and then he answered perplexingly and brokenly.  He was a
36	driver in the artillery, and had only come into action about seven.  At
36	that time firing was going on across the common, and it was said the
36	first party of Martians were crawling slowly towards their second
36	cylinder under cover of a metal shield.
36	
36	Later this shield staggered up on tripod legs and became the first
36	of the fighting-machines I had seen.  The gun he drove had been
36	unlimbered near Horsell, in order to command the sand pits, and its
36	arrival it was that had precipitated the action.  As the limber
36	gunners went to the rear, his horse trod in a rabbit hole and came
36	down, throwing him into a depression of the ground.  At the same
36	moment the gun exploded behind him, the ammunition blew up, there was
36	fire all about him, and he found himself lying under a heap of charred
36	dead men and dead horses.
36	
36	""I lay still,"" he said, ""scared out of my wits, with the fore quarter
36	of a horse atop of me.  We'd been wiped out.  And the smell--good
36	God!  Like burnt meat!  I was hurt across the back by the fall of
36	the horse, and there I had to lie until I felt better.  Just like
36	parade it had been a minute before--then stumble, bang, swish!""
36	
36	""Wiped out!"" he said.
36	
36	He had hid under the dead horse for a long time, peeping out
36	furtively across the common.  The Cardigan men had tried a rush, in
36	skirmishing order, at the pit, simply to be swept out of existence.
36	Then the monster had risen to its feet and had begun to walk leisurely
36	to and fro across the common among the few fugitives, with its
36	headlike hood turning about exactly like the head of a cowled human
36	being.  A kind of arm carried a complicated metallic case, about which
36	green flashes scintillated, and out of the funnel of this there smoked
36	the Heat-Ray.
36	
36	In a few minutes there was, so far as the soldier could see, not a
36	living thing left upon the common, and every bush and tree upon it
36	that was not already a blackened skeleton was burning.  The hussars
36	had been on the road beyond the curvature of the ground, and he saw
36	nothing of them.  He heard the Martians rattle for a time and then
36	become still.  The giant saved Woking station and its cluster of houses
36	until the last; then in a moment the Heat-Ray was brought to bear, and
36	the town became a heap of fiery ruins.  Then the Thing shut off the
36	Heat-Ray, and turning its back upon the artilleryman, began to waddle
36	away towards the smouldering pine woods that sheltered the second
36	cylinder.  As it did so a second glittering Titan built itself up out
36	of the pit.
36	
36	The second monster followed the first, and at that the artilleryman
36	began to crawl very cautiously across the hot heather ash towards
36	Horsell.  He managed to get alive into the ditch by the side of the
36	road, and so escaped to Woking.  There his story became ejaculatory.
36	The place was impassable.  It seems there were a few people alive
36	there, frantic for the most part and many burned and scalded.  He was
36	turned aside by the fire, and hid among some almost scorching heaps of
36	broken wall as one of the Martian giants returned.  He saw this one
36	pursue a man, catch him up in one of its steely tentacles, and knock
36	his head against the trunk of a pine tree.  At last, after nightfall,
36	the artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railway
36	embankment.
36	
36	Since then he had been skulking along towards Maybury, in the hope
36	of getting out of danger Londonward.  People were hiding in trenches
36	and cellars, and many of the survivors had made off towards Woking
36	village and Send.  He had been consumed with thirst until he found one
36	of the water mains near the railway arch smashed, and the water
36	bubbling out like a spring upon the road.
36	
36	That was the story I got from him, bit by bit.  He grew calmer
36	telling me and trying to make me see the things he had seen.  He had
36	eaten no food since midday, he told me early in his narrative, and I
36	found some mutton and bread in the pantry and brought it into the
36	room.  We lit no lamp for fear of attracting the Martians, and ever
36	and again our hands would touch upon bread or meat.  As he talked,
36	things about us came darkly out of the darkness, and the trampled
36	bushes and broken rose trees outside the window grew distinct.  It
36	would seem that a number of men or animals had rushed across the lawn.
36	I began to see his face, blackened and haggard, as no doubt mine was
36	also.
36	
36	When we had finished eating we went softly upstairs to my study,
36	and I looked again out of the open window.  In one night the valley
36	had become a valley of ashes.  The fires had dwindled now.  Where
36	flames had been there were now streamers of smoke; but the countless
36	ruins of shattered and gutted houses and blasted and blackened trees
36	that the night had hidden stood out now gaunt and terrible in the
36	pitiless light of dawn.  Yet here and there some object had had the
36	luck to escape--a white railway signal here, the end of a greenhouse
36	there, white and fresh amid the wreckage.  Never before in the history
36	of warfare had destruction been so indiscriminate and so universal.
36	And shining with the growing light of the east, three of the metallic
36	giants stood about the pit, their cowls rotating as though they were
36	surveying the desolation they had made.
36	
36	It seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged, and ever and again
36	puffs of vivid green vapour streamed up and out of it towards the
36	brightening dawn--streamed up, whirled, broke, and vanished.
36	
36	Beyond were the pillars of fire about Chobham.  They became pillars
36	of bloodshot smoke at the first touch of day.
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER TWELVE
36	
36	WHAT I SAW OF THE DESTRUCTION OF WEYBRIDGE AND SHEPPERTON
36	
36	
36	As the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the window from which we
36	had watched the Martians, and went very quietly downstairs.
36	
36	The artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no place to stay
36	in.  He proposed, he said, to make his way Londonward, and thence
36	rejoin his battery--No. 12, of the Horse Artillery.  My plan was to
36	return at once to Leatherhead; and so greatly had the strength of the
36	Martians impressed me that I had determined to take my wife to
36	Newhaven, and go with her out of the country forthwith.  For I already
36	perceived clearly that the country about London must inevitably be the
36	scene of a disastrous struggle before such creatures as these could be
36	destroyed.
36	
36	Between us and Leatherhead, however, lay the third cylinder, with
36	its guarding giants.  Had I been alone, I think I should have taken my
36	chance and struck across country.  But the artilleryman dissuaded me:
36	""It's no kindness to the right sort of wife,"" he said, ""to make her a
36	widow""; and in the end I agreed to go with him, under cover of the
36	woods, northward as far as Street Cobham before I parted with him.
36	Thence I would make a big detour by Epsom to reach Leatherhead.
36	
36	I should have started at once, but my companion had been in active
36	service and he knew better than that.  He made me ransack the house
36	for a flask, which he filled with whiskey; and we lined every
36	available pocket with packets of biscuits and slices of meat.  Then
36	we crept out of the house, and ran as quickly as we could down the
36	ill-made road by which I had come overnight.  The houses seemed
36	deserted. In the road lay a group of three charred bodies close
36	together, struck dead by the Heat-Ray; and here and there were things
36	that people had dropped--a clock, a slipper, a silver spoon, and the
36	like poor valuables.  At the corner turning up towards the post
36	office a little cart, filled with boxes and furniture, and horseless,
36	heeled over on a broken wheel.  A cash box had been hastily smashed
36	open and thrown under the debris.
36	
36	Except the lodge at the Orphanage, which was still on fire, none of
36	the houses had suffered very greatly here.  The Heat-Ray had shaved
36	the chimney tops and passed.  Yet, save ourselves, there did not seem
36	to be a living soul on Maybury Hill.  The majority of the inhabitants
36	had escaped, I suppose, by way of the Old Woking road--the road I had
36	taken when I drove to Leatherhead--or they had hidden.
36	
36	We went down the lane, by the body of the man in black, sodden now
36	from the overnight hail, and broke into the woods at the foot of the
36	hill.  We pushed through these towards the railway without meeting a
36	soul.  The woods across the line were but the scarred and blackened
36	ruins of woods; for the most part the trees had fallen, but a certain
36	proportion still stood, dismal grey stems, with dark brown foliage
36	instead of green.
36	
36	On our side the fire had done no more than scorch the nearer trees;
36	it had failed to secure its footing.  In one place the woodmen had
36	been at work on Saturday; trees, felled and freshly trimmed, lay in a
36	clearing, with heaps of sawdust by the sawing-machine and its engine.
36	Hard by was a temporary hut, deserted.  There was not a breath of wind
36	this morning, and everything was strangely still.  Even the birds were
36	hushed, and as we hurried along I and the artilleryman talked in
36	whispers and looked now and again over our shoulders.  Once or twice
36	we stopped to listen.
36	
36	After a time we drew near the road, and as we did so we heard the
36	clatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiers
36	riding slowly towards Woking.  We hailed them, and they halted while
36	we hurried towards them.  It was a lieutenant and a couple of privates
36	of the 8th Hussars, with a stand like a theodolite, which the
36	artilleryman told me was a heliograph.
36	
36	""You are the first men I've seen coming this way this morning,""
36	said the lieutenant.  ""What's brewing?""
36	
36	His voice and face were eager.  The men behind him stared
36	curiously.  The artilleryman jumped down the bank into the road and
36	saluted.
36	
36	""Gun destroyed last night, sir.  Have been hiding.  Trying to
36	rejoin battery, sir.  You'll come in sight of the Martians, I expect,
36	about half a mile along this road.""
36	
36	""What the dickens are they like?"" asked the lieutenant.
36	
36	""Giants in armour, sir.  Hundred feet high.  Three legs and a body
36	like 'luminium, with a mighty great head in a hood, sir.""
36	
36	""Get out!"" said the lieutenant.  ""What confounded nonsense!""
36	
36	""You'll see, sir.  They carry a kind of box, sir, that shoots fire
36	and strikes you dead.""
36	
36	""What d'ye mean--a gun?""
36	
36	""No, sir,"" and the artilleryman began a vivid account of the Heat-Ray.
36	Halfway through, the lieutenant interrupted him and looked up at
36	me.  I was still standing on the bank by the side of the road.
36	
36	""It's perfectly true,"" I said.
36	
36	""Well,"" said the lieutenant, ""I suppose it's my business to see it
36	too.  Look here""--to the artilleryman--""we're detailed here clearing
36	people out of their houses.  You'd better go along and report yourself
36	to Brigadier-General Marvin, and tell him all you know.  He's at
36	Weybridge.  Know the way?""
36	
36	""I do,"" I said; and he turned his horse southward again.
36	
36	""Half a mile, you say?"" said he.
36	
36	""At most,"" I answered, and pointed over the treetops southward.  He
36	thanked me and rode on, and we saw them no more.
36	
36	Farther along we came upon a group of three women and two children
36	in the road, busy clearing out a labourer's cottage.  They had
36	got hold of a little hand truck, and were piling it up with
36	unclean-looking bundles and shabby furniture.  They were all too
36	assiduously engaged to talk to us as we passed.
36	
36	By Byfleet station we emerged from the pine trees, and found the
36	country calm and peaceful under the morning sunlight.  We were far
36	beyond the range of the Heat-Ray there, and had it not been for the
36	silent desertion of some of the houses, the stirring movement of
36	packing in others, and the knot of soldiers standing on the bridge
36	over the railway and staring down the line towards Woking, the day
36	would have seemed very like any other Sunday.
36	
36	Several farm waggons and carts were moving creakily along the road
36	to Addlestone, and suddenly through the gate of a field we saw, across
36	a stretch of flat meadow, six twelve-pounders standing neatly at equal
36	distances pointing towards Woking.  The gunners stood by the guns
36	waiting, and the ammunition waggons were at a business-like distance.
36	The men stood almost as if under inspection.
36	
36	""That's good!"" said I.  ""They will get one fair shot, at any rate.""
36	
36	The artilleryman hesitated at the gate.
36	
36	""I shall go on,"" he said.
36	
36	Farther on towards Weybridge, just over the bridge, there were a
36	number of men in white fatigue jackets throwing up a long rampart, and
36	more guns behind.
36	
36	""It's bows and arrows against the lightning, anyhow,"" said the
36	artilleryman.  ""They 'aven't seen that fire-beam yet.""
36	
36	The officers who were not actively engaged stood and stared over
36	the treetops southwestward, and the men digging would stop every now
36	and again to stare in the same direction.
36	
36	Byfleet was in a tumult; people packing, and a score of hussars,
36	some of them dismounted, some on horseback, were hunting them about.
36	Three or four black government waggons, with crosses in white circles,
36	and an old omnibus, among other vehicles, were being loaded in the
36	village street.  There were scores of people, most of them
36	sufficiently sabbatical to have assumed their best clothes.  The
36	soldiers were having the greatest difficulty in making them realise
36	the gravity of their position.  We saw one shrivelled old fellow with
36	a huge box and a score or more of flower pots containing orchids,
36	angrily expostulating with the corporal who would leave them behind.
36	I stopped and gripped his arm.
36	
36	""Do you know what's over there?"" I said, pointing at the pine tops
36	that hid the Martians.
36	
36	""Eh?"" said he, turning.  ""I was explainin' these is vallyble.""
36	
36	""Death!"" I shouted.  ""Death is coming!  Death!"" and leaving him to
36	digest that if he could, I hurried on after the artillery-man.  At the
36	corner I looked back.  The soldier had left him, and he was still
36	standing by his box, with the pots of orchids on the lid of it, and
36	staring vaguely over the trees.
36	
36	No one in Weybridge could tell us where the headquarters were
36	established; the whole place was in such confusion as I had never seen
36	in any town before.  Carts, carriages everywhere, the most astonishing
36	miscellany of conveyances and horseflesh.  The respectable inhabitants
36	of the place, men in golf and boating costumes, wives prettily
36	dressed, were packing, river-side loafers energetically helping,
36	children excited, and, for the most part, highly delighted at this
36	astonishing variation of their Sunday experiences.  In the midst of it
36	all the worthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebration,
36	and his bell was jangling out above the excitement.
36	
36	I and the artilleryman, seated on the step of the drinking
36	fountain, made a very passable meal upon what we had brought with
36	us. Patrols of soldiers--here no longer hussars, but grenadiers in
36	white--were warning people to move now or to take refuge in their
36	cellars as soon as the firing began.  We saw as we crossed the
36	railway bridge that a growing crowd of people had assembled in and
36	about the railway station, and the swarming platform was piled with
36	boxes and packages. The ordinary traffic had been stopped, I believe,
36	in order to allow of the passage of troops and guns to Chertsey, and
36	I have heard since that a savage struggle occurred for places in the
36	special trains that were put on at a later hour.
36	
36	We remained at Weybridge until midday, and at that hour we found
36	ourselves at the place near Shepperton Lock where the Wey and Thames
36	join.  Part of the time we spent helping two old women to pack a
36	little cart.  The Wey has a treble mouth, and at this point boats are
36	to be hired, and there was a ferry across the river.  On the
36	Shepperton side was an inn with a lawn, and beyond that the tower of
36	Shepperton Church--it has been replaced by a spire--rose above the
36	trees.
36	
36	Here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives.  As yet the
36	flight had not grown to a panic, but there were already far more
36	people than all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross.
36	People came panting along under heavy burdens; one husband and wife
36	were even carrying a small outhouse door between them, with some of
36	their household goods piled thereon.  One man told us he meant to try
36	to get away from Shepperton station.
36	
36	There was a lot of shouting, and one man was even jesting.  The idea
36	people seemed to have here was that the Martians were simply
36	formidable human beings, who might attack and sack the town, to be
36	certainly destroyed in the end.  Every now and then people would
36	glance nervously across the Wey, at the meadows towards Chertsey, but
36	everything over there was still.
36	
36	Across the Thames, except just where the boats landed, everything
36	was quiet, in vivid contrast with the Surrey side.  The people who
36	landed there from the boats went tramping off down the lane.  The big
36	ferryboat had just made a journey.  Three or four soldiers stood on
36	the lawn of the inn, staring and jesting at the fugitives, without
36	offering to help.  The inn was closed, as it was now within prohibited
36	hours.
36	
36	""What's that?"" cried a boatman, and ""Shut up, you fool!"" said a man
36	near me to a yelping dog.  Then the sound came again, this time from
36	the direction of Chertsey, a muffled thud--the sound of a gun.
36	
36	The fighting was beginning.  Almost immediately unseen batteries
36	across the river to our right, unseen because of the trees, took up
36	the chorus, firing heavily one after the other.  A woman screamed.
36	Everyone stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle, near us and yet
36	invisible to us.  Nothing was to be seen save flat meadows, cows
36	feeding unconcernedly for the most part, and silvery pollard willows
36	motionless in the warm sunlight.
36	
36	""The sojers'll stop 'em,"" said a woman beside me, doubtfully.  A
36	haziness rose over the treetops.
36	
36	Then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river, a puff
36	of smoke that jerked up into the air and hung; and forthwith the
36	ground heaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air, smashing
36	two or three windows in the houses near, and leaving us astonished.
36	
36	""Here they are!"" shouted a man in a blue jersey.  ""Yonder! D'yer
36	see them?  Yonder!""
36	
36	Quickly, one after the other, one, two, three, four of the armoured
36	Martians appeared, far away over the little trees, across the flat
36	meadows that stretched towards Chertsey, and striding hurriedly
36	towards the river.  Little cowled figures they seemed at first, going
36	with a rolling motion and as fast as flying birds.
36	
36	Then, advancing obliquely towards us, came a fifth.  Their armoured
36	bodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the
36	guns, growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer.  One on the extreme
36	left, the remotest that is, flourished a huge case high in the air,
36	and the ghostly, terrible Heat-Ray I had already seen on Friday night
36	smote towards Chertsey, and struck the town.
36	
36	At sight of these strange, swift, and terrible creatures the crowd
36	near the water's edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror-struck.
36	There was no screaming or shouting, but a silence.  Then a hoarse
36	murmur and a movement of feet--a splashing from the water.  A man, too
36	frightened to drop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder, swung
36	round and sent me staggering with a blow from the corner of his
36	burden.  A woman thrust at me with her hand and rushed past me.  I
36	turned with the rush of the people, but I was not too terrified for
36	thought.  The terrible Heat-Ray was in my mind.  To get under water!
36	That was it!
36	
36	""Get under water!"" I shouted, unheeded.
36	
36	I faced about again, and rushed towards the approaching Martian,
36	rushed right down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water.
36	Others did the same.  A boatload of people putting back came leaping
36	out as I rushed past.  The stones under my feet were muddy and
36	slippery, and the river was so low that I ran perhaps twenty feet
36	scarcely waist-deep.  Then, as the Martian towered overhead scarcely
36	a couple of hundred yards away, I flung myself forward under the
36	surface.  The splashes of the people in the boats leaping into the
36	river sounded like thunderclaps in my ears.  People were landing
36	hastily on both sides of the river.  But the Martian machine took no
36	more notice for the moment of the people running this way and that
36	than a man would of the confusion of ants in a nest against which his
36	foot has kicked.  When, half suffocated, I raised my head above water,
36	the Martian's hood pointed at the batteries that were still firing
36	across the river, and as it advanced it swung loose what must have
36	been the generator of the Heat-Ray.
36	
36	In another moment it was on the bank, and in a stride wading
36	halfway across.  The knees of its foremost legs bent at the farther
36	bank, and in another moment it had raised itself to its full height
36	again, close to the village of Shepperton.  Forthwith the six guns
36	which, unknown to anyone on the right bank, had been hidden behind the
36	outskirts of that village, fired simultaneously.  The sudden near
36	concussion, the last close upon the first, made my heart jump.  The
36	monster was already raising the case generating the Heat-Ray as the
36	first shell burst six yards above the hood.
36	
36	I gave a cry of astonishment.  I saw and thought nothing of the
36	other four Martian monsters; my attention was riveted upon the nearer
36	incident.  Simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the
36	body as the hood twisted round in time to receive, but not in time to
36	dodge, the fourth shell.
36	
36	The shell burst clean in the face of the Thing.  The hood bulged,
36	flashed, was whirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of red flesh
36	and glittering metal.
36	
36	""Hit!"" shouted I, with something between a scream and a cheer.
36	
36	I heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me.  I
36	could have leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation.
36	
36	The decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken giant; but it did
36	not fall over.  It recovered its balance by a miracle, and, no longer
36	heeding its steps and with the camera that fired the Heat-Ray now
36	rigidly upheld, it reeled swiftly upon Shepperton.  The living
36	intelligence, the Martian within the hood, was slain and splashed to
36	the four winds of heaven, and the Thing was now but a mere intricate
36	device of metal whirling to destruction.  It drove along in a straight
36	line, incapable of guidance.  It struck the tower of Shepperton
36	Church, smashing it down as the impact of a battering ram might have
36	done, swerved aside, blundered on and collapsed with tremendous force
36	into the river out of my sight.
36	
36	A violent explosion shook the air, and a spout of water, steam,
36	mud, and shattered metal shot far up into the sky.  As the camera of
36	the Heat-Ray hit the water, the latter had immediately flashed into
36	steam.  In another moment a huge wave, like a muddy tidal bore but
36	almost scaldingly hot, came sweeping round the bend upstream.  I saw
36	people struggling shorewards, and heard their screaming and shouting
36	faintly above the seething and roar of the Martian's collapse.
36	
36	For a moment I heeded nothing of the heat, forgot the patent need
36	of self-preservation.  I splashed through the tumultuous water,
36	pushing aside a man in black to do so, until I could see round the
36	bend.  Half a dozen deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon the
36	confusion of the waves.  The fallen Martian came into sight
36	downstream, lying across the river, and for the most part submerged.
36	
36	Thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage, and through
36	the tumultuously whirling wisps I could see, intermittently and
36	vaguely, the gigantic limbs churning the water and flinging a splash
36	and spray of mud and froth into the air.  The tentacles swayed and
36	struck like living arms, and, save for the helpless purposelessness of
36	these movements, it was as if some wounded thing were struggling for
36	its life amid the waves.  Enormous quantities of a ruddy-brown fluid
36	were spurting up in noisy jets out of the machine.
36	
36	My attention was diverted from this death flurry by a furious
36	yelling, like that of the thing called a siren in our manufacturing
36	towns.  A man, knee-deep near the towing path, shouted inaudibly to me
36	and pointed.  Looking back, I saw the other Martians advancing with
36	gigantic strides down the riverbank from the direction of Chertsey.
36	The Shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly.
36	
36	At that I ducked at once under water, and, holding my breath until
36	movement was an agony, blundered painfully ahead under the surface as
36	long as I could.  The water was in a tumult about me, and rapidly
36	growing hotter.
36	
36	When for a moment I raised my head to take breath and throw the
36	hair and water from my eyes, the steam was rising in a whirling white
36	fog that at first hid the Martians altogether.  The noise was
36	deafening.  Then I saw them dimly, colossal figures of grey, magnified
36	by the mist.  They had passed by me, and two were stooping over the
36	frothing, tumultuous ruins of their comrade.
36	
36	The third and fourth stood beside him in the water, one perhaps two
36	hundred yards from me, the other towards Laleham.  The generators of
36	the Heat-Rays waved high, and the hissing beams smote down this way
36	and that.
36	
36	The air was full of sound, a deafening and confusing conflict of
36	noises--the clangorous din of the Martians, the crash of falling
36	houses, the thud of trees, fences, sheds flashing into flame, and the
36	crackling and roaring of fire.  Dense black smoke was leaping up to
36	mingle with the steam from the river, and as the Heat-Ray went to and
36	fro over Weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent
36	white, that gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames.  The
36	nearer houses still stood intact, awaiting their fate, shadowy, faint
36	and pallid in the steam, with the fire behind them going to and fro.
36	
36	For a moment perhaps I stood there, breast-high in the almost
36	boiling water, dumbfounded at my position, hopeless of escape.  Through
36	the reek I could see the people who had been with me in the river
36	scrambling out of the water through the reeds, like little frogs
36	hurrying through grass from the advance of a man, or running to and
36	fro in utter dismay on the towing path.
36	
36	Then suddenly the white flashes of the Heat-Ray came leaping
36	towards me.  The houses caved in as they dissolved at its touch, and
36	darted out flames; the trees changed to fire with a roar.  The Ray
36	flickered up and down the towing path, licking off the people who ran
36	this way and that, and came down to the water's edge not fifty yards
36	from where I stood.  It swept across the river to Shepperton, and the
36	water in its track rose in a boiling weal crested with steam.  I
36	turned shoreward.
36	
36	In another moment the huge wave, well-nigh at the boiling-point had
36	rushed upon me.  I screamed aloud, and scalded, half blinded,
36	agonised, I staggered through the leaping, hissing water towards the
36	shore.  Had my foot stumbled, it would have been the end.  I fell
36	helplessly, in full sight of the Martians, upon the broad, bare
36	gravelly spit that runs down to mark the angle of the Wey and Thames.
36	I expected nothing but death.
36	
36	I have a dim memory of the foot of a Martian coming down within a
36	score of yards of my head, driving straight into the loose gravel,
36	whirling it this way and that and lifting again; of a long suspense,
36	and then of the four carrying the debris of their comrade between
36	them, now clear and then presently faint through a veil of smoke,
36	receding interminably, as it seemed to me, across a vast space of
36	river and meadow.  And then, very slowly, I realised that by a miracle
36	I had escaped.
36

36	CHAPTER THIRTEEN
36	
36	HOW I FELL IN WITH THE CURATE
36	
36	
36	After getting this sudden lesson in the power of terrestrial
36	weapons, the Martians retreated to their original position upon
36	Horsell Common; and in their haste, and encumbered with the debris of
36	their smashed companion, they no doubt overlooked many such a stray
36	and negligible victim as myself.  Had they left their comrade and
36	pushed on forthwith, there was nothing at that time between them and
36	London but batteries of twelve-pounder guns, and they would certainly
36	have reached the capital in advance of the tidings of their approach;
36	as sudden, dreadful, and destructive their advent would have been as
36	the earthquake that destroyed Lisbon a century ago.
36	
36	But they were in no hurry.  Cylinder followed cylinder on its
36	interplanetary flight; every twenty-four hours brought them
36	reinforcement.  And meanwhile the military and naval authorities, now
36	fully alive to the tremendous power of their antagonists, worked with
36	furious energy.  Every minute a fresh gun came into position until,
36	before twilight, every copse, every row of suburban villas on the
36	hilly slopes about Kingston and Richmond, masked an expectant black
36	muzzle.  And through the charred and desolated area--perhaps twenty
36	square miles altogether--that encircled the Martian encampment on
36	Horsell Common, through charred and ruined villages among the green
36	trees, through the blackened and smoking arcades that had been but a
36	day ago pine spinneys, crawled the devoted scouts with the heliographs
36	that were presently to warn the gunners of the Martian approach.  But
36	the Martians now understood our command of artillery and the danger of
36	human proximity, and not a man ventured within a mile of either
36	cylinder, save at the price of his life.
36	
36	It would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of the
36	afternoon in going to and fro, transferring everything from the second
36	and third cylinders--the second in Addlestone Golf Links and the third
36	at Pyrford--to their original pit on Horsell Common.  Over that, above
36	the blackened heather and ruined buildings that stretched far and
36	wide, stood one as sentinel, while the rest abandoned their vast
36	fighting-machines and descended into the pit.  They were hard at work
36	there far into the night, and the towering pillar of dense green smoke
36	that rose therefrom could be seen from the hills about Merrow, and
36	even, it is said, from Banstead and Epsom Downs.
36	
36	And while the Martians behind me were thus preparing for their next
36	sally, and in front of me Humanity gathered for the battle, I made my
36	way with infinite pains and labour from the fire and smoke of burning
36	Weybridge towards London.
36	
36	I saw an abandoned boat, very small and remote, drifting down-stream;
36	and throwing off the most of my sodden clothes, I went after it,
36	gained it, and so escaped out of that destruction.  There were no
36	oars in the boat, but I contrived to paddle, as well as my parboiled
36	hands would allow, down the river towards Halliford and Walton, going
36	very tediously and continually looking behind me, as you may well
36	understand.  I followed the river, because I considered that the water
36	gave me my best chance of escape should these giants return.
36	
36	The hot water from the Martian's overthrow drifted downstream with
36	me, so that for the best part of a mile I could see little of either
36	bank.  Once, however, I made out a string of black figures hurrying
36	across the meadows from the direction of Weybridge.  Halliford, it
36	seemed, was deserted, and several of the houses facing the river were
36	on fire.  It was strange to see the place quite tranquil, quite
36	desolate under the hot blue sky, with the smoke and little threads of
36	flame going straight up into the heat of the afternoon.  Never before
36	had I seen houses burning without the accompaniment of an obstructive
36	crowd.  A little farther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and
36	glowing, and a line of fire inland was marching steadily across a late
36	field of hay.
36	
36	For a long time I drifted, so painful and weary was I after the
36	violence I had been through, and so intense the heat upon the water.
36	Then my fears got the better of me again, and I resumed my paddling.
36	The sun scorched my bare back.  At last, as the bridge at Walton was
36	coming into sight round the bend, my fever and faintness overcame my
36	fears, and I landed on the Middlesex bank and lay down, deadly sick,
36	amid the long grass.  I suppose the time was then about four or five
36	o'clock.  I got up presently, walked perhaps half a mile without
36	meeting a soul, and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge.  I
36	seem to remember talking, wanderingly, to myself during that last
36	spurt.  I was also very thirsty, and bitterly regretful I had drunk no
36	more water.  It is a curious thing that I felt angry with my wife; I
36	cannot account for it, but my impotent desire to reach Leatherhead
36	worried me excessively.
36	
36	I do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate, so that probably
36	I dozed.  I became aware of him as a seated figure in soot-smudged
36	shirt sleeves, and with his upturned, clean-shaven face staring at
36	a faint flickering that danced over the sky.  The sky was what is
36	called a mackerel sky--rows and rows of faint down-plumes of
36	cloud, just tinted with the midsummer sunset.
36	
36	I sat up, and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me quickly.
36	
36	""Have you any water?"" I asked abruptly.
36	
36	He shook his head.
36	
36	""You have been asking for water for the last hour,"" he said.
36	
36	For a moment we were silent, taking stock of each other.  I
36	dare say he found me a strange enough figure, naked, save for my
36	water-soaked trousers and socks, scalded, and my face and shoulders
36	blackened by the smoke.  His face was a fair weakness, his chin
36	retreated, and his hair lay in crisp, almost flaxen curls on his low
36	forehead; his eyes were rather large, pale blue, and blankly staring.
36	He spoke abruptly, looking vacantly away from me.
36	
36	""What does it mean?"" he said.  ""What do these things mean?""
36	
36	I stared at him and made no answer.
36	
36	He extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a complaining
36	tone.
36	
36	""Why are these things permitted?  What sins have we done?  The
36	morning service was over, I was walking through the roads to clear my
36	brain for the afternoon, and then--fire, earthquake, death!  As if it
36	were Sodom and Gomorrah!  All our work undone, all the work---- What
36	are these Martians?""
36	
36	""What are we?"" I answered, clearing my throat.
36	
36	He gripped his knees and turned to look at me again.  For half a
36	minute, perhaps, he stared silently.
36	
36	""I was walking through the roads to clear my brain,"" he said.  ""And
36	suddenly--fire, earthquake, death!""
36	
36	He relapsed into silence, with his chin now sunken almost to his
36	knees.
36	
36	Presently he began waving his hand.
36	
36	""All the work--all the Sunday schools--What have we done--what has
36	Weybridge done?  Everything gone--everything destroyed.  The church!
36	We rebuilt it only three years ago.  Gone!  Swept out of existence!
36	Why?""
36	
36	Another pause, and he broke out again like one demented.
36	
36	""The smoke of her burning goeth up for ever and ever!"" he shouted.
36	
36	His eyes flamed, and he pointed a lean finger in the direction of
36	Weybridge.
36	
36	By this time I was beginning to take his measure.  The tremendous
36	tragedy in which he had been involved--it was evident he was a
36	fugitive from Weybridge--had driven him to the very verge of his
36	reason.
36	
36	""Are we far from Sunbury?"" I said, in a matter-of-fact tone.
36	
36	""What are we to do?"" he asked.  ""Are these creatures everywhere?
36	Has the earth been given over to them?""
36	
36	""Are we far from Sunbury?""
36	
36	""Only this morning I officiated at early celebration----""
36	
36	""Things have changed,"" I said, quietly.  ""You must keep your head.
36	There is still hope.""
36	
36	""Hope!""
36	
36	""Yes.  Plentiful hope--for all this destruction!""
36	
36	I began to explain my view of our position.  He listened at first,
36	but as I went on the interest dawning in his eyes gave place to their
36	former stare, and his regard wandered from me.
36	
36	""This must be the beginning of the end,"" he said, interrupting me.
36	""The end!  The great and terrible day of the Lord!  When men shall
36	call upon the mountains and the rocks to fall upon them and hide
36	them--hide them from the face of Him that sitteth upon the throne!""
36	
36	I began to understand the position.  I ceased my laboured
36	reasoning, struggled to my feet, and, standing over him, laid my hand
36	on his shoulder.
36	
36	""Be a man!"" said I.  ""You are scared out of your wits!  What good
36	is religion if it collapses under calamity?  Think of what earthquakes
36	and floods, wars and volcanoes, have done before to men!  Did you
36	think God had exempted Weybridge?  He is not an insurance agent.""
36	
36	For a time he sat in blank silence.
36	
36	""But how can we escape?"" he asked, suddenly.  ""They are
36	invulnerable, they are pitiless.""
36	
36	""Neither the one nor, perhaps, the other,"" I answered. ""And the
36	mightier they are the more sane and wary should we be.  One of them
36	was killed yonder not three hours ago.""
36	
36	""Killed!"" he said, staring about him.  ""How can God's ministers be
36	killed?""
36	
36	""I saw it happen."" I proceeded to tell him.  ""We have chanced to
36	come in for the thick of it,"" said I, ""and that is all.""
36	
36	""What is that flicker in the sky?"" he asked abruptly.
36	
36	I told him it was the heliograph signalling--that it was the sign
36	of human help and effort in the sky.
36	
36	""We are in the midst of it,"" I said, ""quiet as it is.  That flicker
36	in the sky tells of the gathering storm.  Yonder, I take it are the
36	Martians, and Londonward, where those hills rise about Richmond and
36	Kingston and the trees give cover, earthworks are being thrown up and
36	guns are being placed.  Presently the Martians will be coming this way
36	again.""
36	
36	And even as I spoke he sprang to his feet and stopped me by a
36	gesture.
36	
36	""Listen!"" he said.
36	
36	From beyond the low hills across the water came the dull resonance
36	of distant guns and a remote weird crying.  Then everything was still.
36	A cockchafer came droning over the hedge and past us.  High in the
36	west the crescent moon hung faint and pale above the smoke of
36	Weybridge and Shepperton and the hot, still splendour of the sunset.
36	
36	""We had better follow this path,"" I said, ""northward.""
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER FOURTEEN
36	
36	IN LONDON
36	
36	
36	My younger brother was in London when the Martians fell at Woking.
36	He was a medical student working for an imminent examination, and he
36	heard nothing of the arrival until Saturday morning.  The morning
36	papers on Saturday contained, in addition to lengthy special articles
36	on the planet Mars, on life in the planets, and so forth, a brief and
36	vaguely worded telegram, all the more striking for its brevity.
36	
36	The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed a
36	number of people with a quick-firing gun, so the story ran.  The
36	telegram concluded with the words: ""Formidable as they seem to be, the
36	Martians have not moved from the pit into which they have fallen, and,
36	indeed, seem incapable of doing so.  Probably this is due to the
36	relative strength of the earth's gravitational energy.""  On that last
36	text their leader-writer expanded very comfortingly.
36	
36	Of course all the students in the crammer's biology class, to which
36	my brother went that day, were intensely interested, but there were no
36	signs of any unusual excitement in the streets.  The afternoon papers
36	puffed scraps of news under big headlines.  They had nothing to tell
36	beyond the movements of troops about the common, and the burning of
36	the pine woods between Woking and Weybridge, until eight.  Then the
36	_St. James's Gazette_, in an extra-special edition, announced the bare
36	fact of the interruption of telegraphic communication.  This was
36	thought to be due to the falling of burning pine trees across the
36	line.  Nothing more of the fighting was known that night, the night of
36	my drive to Leatherhead and back.
36	
36	My brother felt no anxiety about us, as he knew from the
36	description in the papers that the cylinder was a good two miles from
36	my house.  He made up his mind to run down that night to me, in order,
36	as he says, to see the Things before they were killed.  He dispatched
36	a telegram, which never reached me, about four o'clock, and spent the
36	evening at a music hall.
36	
36	In London, also, on Saturday night there was a thunderstorm, and my
36	brother reached Waterloo in a cab.  On the platform from which the
36	midnight train usually starts he learned, after some waiting, that an
36	accident prevented trains from reaching Woking that night.  The nature
36	of the accident he could not ascertain; indeed, the railway
36	authorities did not clearly know at that time.  There was very little
36	excitement in the station, as the officials, failing to realise that
36	anything further than a breakdown between Byfleet and Woking junction
36	had occurred, were running the theatre trains which usually passed
36	through Woking round by Virginia Water or Guildford.  They were busy
36	making the necessary arrangements to alter the route of the
36	Southampton and Portsmouth Sunday League excursions.  A nocturnal
36	newspaper reporter, mistaking my brother for the traffic manager, to
36	whom he bears a slight resemblance, waylaid and tried to interview
36	him.  Few people, excepting the railway officials, connected the
36	breakdown with the Martians.
36	
36	I have read, in another account of these events, that on Sunday
36	morning ""all London was electrified by the news from Woking.""  As a
36	matter of fact, there was nothing to justify that very extravagant
36	phrase.  Plenty of Londoners did not hear of the Martians until the
36	panic of Monday morning.  Those who did took some time to realise all
36	that the hastily worded telegrams in the Sunday papers conveyed.  The
36	majority of people in London do not read Sunday papers.
36	
36	The habit of personal security, moreover, is so deeply fixed in the
36	Londoner's mind, and startling intelligence so much a matter of course
36	in the papers, that they could read without any personal tremors:
36	""About seven o'clock last night the Martians came out of the cylinder,
36	and, moving about under an armour of metallic shields, have completely
36	wrecked Woking station with the adjacent houses, and massacred an
36	entire battalion of the Cardigan Regiment.  No details are known.
36	Maxims have been absolutely useless against their armour; the field
36	guns have been disabled by them.  Flying hussars have been galloping
36	into Chertsey.  The Martians appear to be moving slowly towards
36	Chertsey or Windsor.  Great anxiety prevails in West Surrey, and
36	earthworks are being thrown up to check the advance Londonward.""  That
36	was how the Sunday _Sun_ put it, and a clever and remarkably prompt
36	""handbook"" article in the _Referee_ compared the affair to a menagerie
36	suddenly let loose in a village.
36	
36	No one in London knew positively of the nature of the armoured
36	Martians, and there was still a fixed idea that these monsters must be
36	sluggish: ""crawling,"" ""creeping painfully""--such expressions occurred
36	in almost all the earlier reports.  None of the telegrams could have
36	been written by an eyewitness of their advance.  The Sunday papers
36	printed separate editions as further news came to hand, some even in
36	default of it.  But there was practically nothing more to tell people
36	until late in the afternoon, when the authorities gave the press
36	agencies the news in their possession.  It was stated that the people
36	of Walton and Weybridge, and all the district were pouring along the
36	roads Londonward, and that was all.
36	
36	My brother went to church at the Foundling Hospital in the morning,
36	still in ignorance of what had happened on the previous night.  There
36	he heard allusions made to the invasion, and a special prayer for
36	peace.  Coming out, he bought a _Referee_.  He became alarmed at the
36	news in this, and went again to Waterloo station to find out if
36	communication were restored.  The omnibuses, carriages, cyclists, and
36	innumerable people walking in their best clothes seemed scarcely
36	affected by the strange intelligence that the news venders were
36	disseminating.  People were interested, or, if alarmed, alarmed only
36	on account of the local residents.  At the station he heard for the
36	first time that the Windsor and Chertsey lines were now interrupted.
36	The porters told him that several remarkable telegrams had been
36	received in the morning from Byfleet and Chertsey stations, but that
36	these had abruptly ceased.  My brother could get very little precise
36	detail out of them.
36	
36	""There's fighting going on about Weybridge"" was the extent of their
36	information.
36	
36	The train service was now very much disorganised.  Quite a number
36	of people who had been expecting friends from places on the
36	South-Western network were standing about the station.  One
36	grey-headed old gentleman came and abused the South-Western Company
36	bitterly to my brother.  ""It wants showing up,"" he said.
36	
36	One or two trains came in from Richmond, Putney, and Kingston,
36	containing people who had gone out for a day's boating and found the
36	locks closed and a feeling of panic in the air.  A man in a blue and
36	white blazer addressed my brother, full of strange tidings.
36	
36	""There's hosts of people driving into Kingston in traps and carts
36	and things, with boxes of valuables and all that,"" he said.  ""They
36	come from Molesey and Weybridge and Walton, and they say there's been
36	guns heard at Chertsey, heavy firing, and that mounted soldiers have
36	told them to get off at once because the Martians are coming.  We
36	heard guns firing at Hampton Court station, but we thought it was
36	thunder.  What the dickens does it all mean?  The Martians can't get
36	out of their pit, can they?""
36	
36	My brother could not tell him.
36	
36	Afterwards he found that the vague feeling of alarm had spread to
36	the clients of the underground railway, and that the Sunday
36	excursionists began to return from all over the South-Western
36	""lung""--Barnes, Wimbledon, Richmond Park, Kew, and so forth--at
36	unnaturally early hours; but not a soul had anything more than vague
36	hearsay to tell of.  Everyone connected with the terminus seemed
36	ill-tempered.
36	
36	About five o'clock the gathering crowd in the station was immensely
36	excited by the opening of the line of communication, which is almost
36	invariably closed, between the South-Eastern and the South-Western
36	stations, and the passage of carriage trucks bearing huge guns and
36	carriages crammed with soldiers.  These were the guns that were
36	brought up from Woolwich and Chatham to cover Kingston.  There was
36	an exchange of pleasantries: ""You'll get eaten!""  ""We're the
36	beast-tamers!"" and so forth.  A little while after that a squad of
36	police came into the station and began to clear the public off the
36	platforms, and my brother went out into the street again.
36	
36	The church bells were ringing for evensong, and a squad of
36	Salvation Army lassies came singing down Waterloo Road.  On the bridge
36	a number of loafers were watching a curious brown scum that came
36	drifting down the stream in patches.  The sun was just setting, and the
36	Clock Tower and the Houses of Parliament rose against one of the most
36	peaceful skies it is possible to imagine, a sky of gold, barred with
36	long transverse stripes of reddish-purple cloud.  There was talk of a
36	floating body.  One of the men there, a reservist he said he was, told
36	my brother he had seen the heliograph flickering in the west.
36	
36	In Wellington Street my brother met a couple of sturdy roughs who
36	had just been rushed out of Fleet Street with still-wet newspapers and
36	staring placards.  ""Dreadful catastrophe!"" they bawled one to the
36	other down Wellington Street.  ""Fighting at Weybridge!  Full
36	description!  Repulse of the Martians! London in Danger!""  He had to
36	give threepence for a copy of that paper.
36	
36	Then it was, and then only, that he realised something of the full
36	power and terror of these monsters.  He learned that they were not
36	merely a handful of small sluggish creatures, but that they were minds
36	swaying vast mechanical bodies; and that they could move swiftly and
36	smite with such power that even the mightiest guns could not stand
36	against them.
36	
36	They were described as ""vast spiderlike machines, nearly a hundred
36	feet high, capable of the speed of an express train, and able to shoot
36	out a beam of intense heat.""  Masked batteries, chiefly of field guns,
36	had been planted in the country about Horsell Common, and especially
36	between the Woking district and London.  Five of the machines had been
36	seen moving towards the Thames, and one, by a happy chance, had been
36	destroyed.  In the other cases the shells had missed, and the
36	batteries had been at once annihilated by the Heat-Rays.  Heavy
36	losses of soldiers were mentioned, but the tone of the dispatch was
36	optimistic.
36	
36	The Martians had been repulsed; they were not invulnerable.  They
36	had retreated to their triangle of cylinders again, in the circle
36	about Woking.  Signallers with heliographs were pushing forward upon
36	them from all sides.  Guns were in rapid transit from Windsor,
36	Portsmouth, Aldershot, Woolwich--even from the north; among others,
36	long wire-guns of ninety-five tons from Woolwich.  Altogether one
36	hundred and sixteen were in position or being hastily placed, chiefly
36	covering London.  Never before in England had there been such a vast
36	or rapid concentration of military material.
36	
36	Any further cylinders that fell, it was hoped, could be destroyed
36	at once by high explosives, which were being rapidly manufactured and
36	distributed.  No doubt, ran the report, the situation was of the
36	strangest and gravest description, but the public was exhorted to
36	avoid and discourage panic.  No doubt the Martians were strange and
36	terrible in the extreme, but at the outside there could not be more
36	than twenty of them against our millions.
36	
36	The authorities had reason to suppose, from the size of the
36	cylinders, that at the outside there could not be more than five in
36	each cylinder--fifteen altogether.  And one at least was disposed
36	of--perhaps more.  The public would be fairly warned of the approach
36	of danger, and elaborate measures were being taken for the protection
36	of the people in the threatened southwestern suburbs.  And so, with
36	reiterated assurances of the safety of London and the ability of the
36	authorities to cope with the difficulty, this quasi-proclamation
36	closed.
36	
36	This was printed in enormous type on paper so fresh that it was
36	still wet, and there had been no time to add a word of comment.  It
36	was curious, my brother said, to see how ruthlessly the usual contents
36	of the paper had been hacked and taken out to give this place.
36	
36	All down Wellington Street people could be seen fluttering out the
36	pink sheets and reading, and the Strand was suddenly noisy with the
36	voices of an army of hawkers following these pioneers.  Men came
36	scrambling off buses to secure copies.  Certainly this news excited
36	people intensely, whatever their previous apathy.  The shutters of a
36	map shop in the Strand were being taken down, my brother said, and a
36	man in his Sunday raiment, lemon-yellow gloves even, was visible
36	inside the window hastily fastening maps of Surrey to the glass.
36	
36	Going on along the Strand to Trafalgar Square, the paper in his
36	hand, my brother saw some of the fugitives from West Surrey.  There
36	was a man with his wife and two boys and some articles of furniture in
36	a cart such as greengrocers use.  He was driving from the direction of
36	Westminster Bridge; and close behind him came a hay waggon with five
36	or six respectable-looking people in it, and some boxes and bundles.
36	The faces of these people were haggard, and their entire appearance
36	contrasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best appearance of the
36	people on the omnibuses.  People in fashionable clothing peeped at
36	them out of cabs.  They stopped at the Square as if undecided which
36	way to take, and finally turned eastward along the Strand.  Some way
36	behind these came a man in workday clothes, riding one of those
36	old-fashioned tricycles with a small front wheel.  He was dirty and
36	white in the face.
36	
36	My brother turned down towards Victoria, and met a number of such
36	people.  He had a vague idea that he might see something of me.  He
36	noticed an unusual number of police regulating the traffic.  Some of
36	the refugees were exchanging news with the people on the omnibuses.
36	One was professing to have seen the Martians.  ""Boilers on stilts, I
36	tell you, striding along like men.""  Most of them were excited and
36	animated by their strange experience.
36	
36	Beyond Victoria the public-houses were doing a lively trade with
36	these arrivals.  At all the street corners groups of people were
36	reading papers, talking excitedly, or staring at these unusual Sunday
36	visitors.  They seemed to increase as night drew on, until at last the
36	roads, my brother said, were like Epsom High Street on a Derby Day.  My
36	brother addressed several of these fugitives and got unsatisfactory
36	answers from most.
36	
36	None of them could tell him any news of Woking except one man, who
36	assured him that Woking had been entirely destroyed on the previous
36	night.
36	
36	""I come from Byfleet,"" he said; ""man on a bicycle came through the
36	place in the early morning, and ran from door to door warning us to
36	come away.  Then came soldiers.  We went out to look, and there were
36	clouds of smoke to the south--nothing but smoke, and not a soul coming
36	that way.  Then we heard the guns at Chertsey, and folks coming from
36	Weybridge.  So I've locked up my house and come on.""
36	
36	At the time there was a strong feeling in the streets that the
36	authorities were to blame for their incapacity to dispose of the
36	invaders without all this inconvenience.
36	
36	About eight o'clock a noise of heavy firing was distinctly audible
36	all over the south of London.  My brother could not hear it for the
36	traffic in the main thoroughfares, but by striking through the quiet
36	back streets to the river he was able to distinguish it quite plainly.
36	
36	He walked from Westminster to his apartments near Regent's Park,
36	about two.  He was now very anxious on my account, and disturbed at
36	the evident magnitude of the trouble.  His mind was inclined to run,
36	even as mine had run on Saturday, on military details.  He thought of
36	all those silent, expectant guns, of the suddenly nomadic countryside;
36	he tried to imagine ""boilers on stilts"" a hundred feet high.
36	
36	There were one or two cartloads of refugees passing along Oxford
36	Street, and several in the Marylebone Road, but so slowly was the news
36	spreading that Regent Street and Portland Place were full of their
36	usual Sunday-night promenaders, albeit they talked in groups, and
36	along the edge of Regent's Park there were as many silent couples
36	""walking out"" together under the scattered gas lamps as ever there had
36	been.  The night was warm and still, and a little oppressive; the
36	sound of guns continued intermittently, and after midnight there
36	seemed to be sheet lightning in the south.
36	
36	He read and re-read the paper, fearing the worst had happened to me.
36	He was restless, and after supper prowled out again aimlessly.  He
36	returned and tried in vain to divert his attention to his examination
36	notes.  He went to bed a little after midnight, and was awakened from
36	lurid dreams in the small hours of Monday by the sound of door
36	knockers, feet running in the street, distant drumming, and a clamour
36	of bells.  Red reflections danced on the ceiling.  For a moment he lay
36	astonished, wondering whether day had come or the world gone mad.
36	Then he jumped out of bed and ran to the window.
36	
36	His room was an attic and as he thrust his head out, up and down
36	the street there were a dozen echoes to the noise of his window sash,
36	and heads in every kind of night disarray appeared.  Enquiries were
36	being shouted.  ""They are coming!"" bawled a policeman, hammering at
36	the door; ""the Martians are coming!"" and hurried to the next door.
36	
36	The sound of drumming and trumpeting came from the Albany Street
36	Barracks, and every church within earshot was hard at work killing
36	sleep with a vehement disorderly tocsin.  There was a noise of doors
36	opening, and window after window in the houses opposite flashed from
36	darkness into yellow illumination.
36	
36	Up the street came galloping a closed carriage, bursting abruptly
36	into noise at the corner, rising to a clattering climax under the
36	window, and dying away slowly in the distance.  Close on the rear of
36	this came a couple of cabs, the forerunners of a long procession of
36	flying vehicles, going for the most part to Chalk Farm station, where
36	the North-Western special trains were loading up, instead of coming
36	down the gradient into Euston.
36	
36	For a long time my brother stared out of the window in blank
36	astonishment, watching the policemen hammering at door after door, and
36	delivering their incomprehensible message.  Then the door behind him
36	opened, and the man who lodged across the landing came in, dressed
36	only in shirt, trousers, and slippers, his braces loose about his
36	waist, his hair disordered from his pillow.
36	
36	""What the devil is it?"" he asked.  ""A fire?  What a devil of a
36	row!""
36	
36	They both craned their heads out of the window, straining to hear
36	what the policemen were shouting.  People were coming out of the side
36	streets, and standing in groups at the corners talking.
36	
36	""What the devil is it all about?"" said my brother's fellow lodger.
36	
36	My brother answered him vaguely and began to dress, running with
36	each garment to the window in order to miss nothing of the growing
36	excitement.  And presently men selling unnaturally early newspapers
36	came bawling into the street:
36	
36	""London in danger of suffocation!  The Kingston and Richmond
36	defences forced!  Fearful massacres in the Thames Valley!""
36	
36	And all about him--in the rooms below, in the houses on each side
36	and across the road, and behind in the Park Terraces and in the
36	hundred other streets of that part of Marylebone, and the Westbourne
36	Park district and St. Pancras, and westward and northward in Kilburn
36	and St. John's Wood and Hampstead, and eastward in Shoreditch and
36	Highbury and Haggerston and Hoxton, and, indeed, through all the
36	vastness of London from Ealing to East Ham--people were rubbing their
36	eyes, and opening windows to stare out and ask aimless questions,
36	dressing hastily as the first breath of the coming storm of Fear blew
36	through the streets.  It was the dawn of the great panic.  London,
36	which had gone to bed on Sunday night oblivious and inert, was
36	awakened, in the small hours of Monday morning, to a vivid sense of
36	danger.
36	
36	Unable from his window to learn what was happening, my brother went
36	down and out into the street, just as the sky between the parapets of
36	the houses grew pink with the early dawn.  The flying people on foot
36	and in vehicles grew more numerous every moment.  ""Black Smoke!"" he
36	heard people crying, and again ""Black Smoke!""  The contagion of such
36	a unanimous fear was inevitable.  As my brother hesitated on the
36	door-step, he saw another news vender approaching, and got a paper
36	forthwith.  The man was running away with the rest, and selling his
36	papers for a shilling each as he ran--a grotesque mingling of profit
36	and panic.
36	
36	And from this paper my brother read that catastrophic dispatch of
36	the Commander-in-Chief:
36	
36	""The Martians are able to discharge enormous clouds of a black and
36	poisonous vapour by means of rockets.  They have smothered our
36	batteries, destroyed Richmond, Kingston, and Wimbledon, and are
36	advancing slowly towards London, destroying everything on the way.  It
36	is impossible to stop them.  There is no safety from the Black Smoke
36	but in instant flight.""
36	
36	That was all, but it was enough.  The whole population of the great
36	six-million city was stirring, slipping, running; presently it would
36	be pouring _en masse_ northward.
36	
36	""Black Smoke!"" the voices cried.  ""Fire!""
36	
36	The bells of the neighbouring church made a jangling tumult, a cart
36	carelessly driven smashed, amid shrieks and curses, against the water
36	trough up the street.  Sickly yellow lights went to and fro in the
36	houses, and some of the passing cabs flaunted unextinguished lamps.
36	And overhead the dawn was growing brighter, clear and steady and calm.
36	
36	He heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms, and up and down
36	stairs behind him.  His landlady came to the door, loosely wrapped in
36	dressing gown and shawl; her husband followed ejaculating.
36	
36	As my brother began to realise the import of all these things, he
36	turned hastily to his own room, put all his available money--some ten
36	pounds altogether--into his pockets, and went out again into the
36	streets.
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER FIFTEEN
36	
36	WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN SURREY
36	
36	
36	It was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me under
36	the hedge in the flat meadows near Halliford, and while my brother was
36	watching the fugitives stream over Westminster Bridge, that the
36	Martians had resumed the offensive.  So far as one can ascertain from
36	the conflicting accounts that have been put forth, the majority of
36	them remained busied with preparations in the Horsell pit until nine
36	that night, hurrying on some operation that disengaged huge volumes of
36	green smoke.
36	
36	But three certainly came out about eight o'clock and, advancing
36	slowly and cautiously, made their way through Byfleet and Pyrford
36	towards Ripley and Weybridge, and so came in sight of the expectant
36	batteries against the setting sun.  These Martians did not advance in
36	a body, but in a line, each perhaps a mile and a half from his nearest
36	fellow.  They communicated with one another by means of sirenlike
36	howls, running up and down the scale from one note to another.
36	
36	It was this howling and firing of the guns at Ripley and St.
36	George's Hill that we had heard at Upper Halliford.  The Ripley
36	gunners, unseasoned artillery volunteers who ought never to have been
36	placed in such a position, fired one wild, premature, ineffectual
36	volley, and bolted on horse and foot through the deserted village,
36	while the Martian, without using his Heat-Ray, walked serenely over
36	their guns, stepped gingerly among them, passed in front of them, and
36	so came unexpectedly upon the guns in Painshill Park, which he
36	destroyed.
36	
36	The St. George's Hill men, however, were better led or of a better
36	mettle.  Hidden by a pine wood as they were, they seem to have been
36	quite unsuspected by the Martian nearest to them.  They laid their
36	guns as deliberately as if they had been on parade, and fired at about
36	a thousand yards' range.
36	
36	The shells flashed all round him, and he was seen to advance a few
36	paces, stagger, and go down.  Everybody yelled together, and the guns
36	were reloaded in frantic haste.  The overthrown Martian set up a
36	prolonged ululation, and immediately a second glittering giant,
36	answering him, appeared over the trees to the south.  It would seem
36	that a leg of the tripod had been smashed by one of the shells.  The
36	whole of the second volley flew wide of the Martian on the ground,
36	and, simultaneously, both his companions brought their Heat-Rays to
36	bear on the battery.  The ammunition blew up, the pine trees all about
36	the guns flashed into fire, and only one or two of the men who were
36	already running over the crest of the hill escaped.
36	
36	After this it would seem that the three took counsel together and
36	halted, and the scouts who were watching them report that they
36	remained absolutely stationary for the next half hour.  The Martian
36	who had been overthrown crawled tediously out of his hood, a small
36	brown figure, oddly suggestive from that distance of a speck of
36	blight, and apparently engaged in the repair of his support.  About
36	nine he had finished, for his cowl was then seen above the trees
36	again.
36	
36	It was a few minutes past nine that night when these three
36	sentinels were joined by four other Martians, each carrying a thick
36	black tube.  A similar tube was handed to each of the three, and the
36	seven proceeded to distribute themselves at equal distances along a
36	curved line between St. George's Hill, Weybridge, and the village of
36	Send, southwest of Ripley.
36	
36	A dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before them so soon as they
36	began to move, and warned the waiting batteries about Ditton and
36	Esher.  At the same time four of their fighting machines, similarly
36	armed with tubes, crossed the river, and two of them, black against
36	the western sky, came into sight of myself and the curate as we
36	hurried wearily and painfully along the road that runs northward out
36	of Halliford.  They moved, as it seemed to us, upon a cloud, for a
36	milky mist covered the fields and rose to a third of their height.
36	
36	At this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat, and began
36	running; but I knew it was no good running from a Martian, and I
36	turned aside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the
36	broad ditch by the side of the road.  He looked back, saw what I was
36	doing, and turned to join me.
36	
36	The two halted, the nearer to us standing and facing Sunbury, the
36	remoter being a grey indistinctness towards the evening star, away
36	towards Staines.
36	
36	The occasional howling of the Martians had ceased; they took up
36	their positions in the huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute
36	silence.  It was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns.  Never
36	since the devising of gunpowder was the beginning of a battle so
36	still.  To us and to an observer about Ripley it would have had
36	precisely the same effect--the Martians seemed in solitary possession
36	of the darkling night, lit only as it was by the slender moon, the
36	stars, the afterglow of the daylight, and the ruddy glare from St.
36	George's Hill and the woods of Painshill.
36	
36	But facing that crescent everywhere--at Staines, Hounslow, Ditton,
36	Esher, Ockham, behind hills and woods south of the river, and across
36	the flat grass meadows to the north of it, wherever a cluster of trees
36	or village houses gave sufficient cover--the guns were waiting.  The
36	signal rockets burst and rained their sparks through the night and
36	vanished, and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose to a
36	tense expectation.  The Martians had but to advance into the line of
36	fire, and instantly those motionless black forms of men, those guns
36	glittering so darkly in the early night, would explode into a
36	thunderous fury of battle.
36	
36	No doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand of those
36	vigilant minds, even as it was uppermost in mine, was the riddle--how
36	much they understood of us.  Did they grasp that we in our millions
36	were organized, disciplined, working together?  Or did they interpret
36	our spurts of fire, the sudden stinging of our shells, our steady
36	investment of their encampment, as we should the furious unanimity of
36	onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees?  Did they dream they might
36	exterminate us?  (At that time no one knew what food they needed.)  A
36	hundred such questions struggled together in my mind as I watched that
36	vast sentinel shape.  And in the back of my mind was the sense of all
36	the huge unknown and hidden forces Londonward.  Had they prepared
36	pitfalls? Were the powder mills at Hounslow ready as a snare?  Would
36	the Londoners have the heart and courage to make a greater Moscow of
36	their mighty province of houses?
36	
36	Then, after an interminable time, as it seemed to us, crouching and
36	peering through the hedge, came a sound like the distant concussion of
36	a gun.  Another nearer, and then another.  And then the Martian beside
36	us raised his tube on high and discharged it, gunwise, with a heavy
36	report that made the ground heave.  The one towards Staines answered
36	him.  There was no flash, no smoke, simply that loaded detonation.
36	
36	I was so excited by these heavy minute-guns following one another
36	that I so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to
36	clamber up into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury.  As I did so a
36	second report followed, and a big projectile hurtled overhead towards
36	Hounslow.  I expected at least to see smoke or fire, or some such
36	evidence of its work.  But all I saw was the deep blue sky above, with
36	one solitary star, and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath.
36	And there had been no crash, no answering explosion.  The silence was
36	restored; the minute lengthened to three.
36	
36	""What has happened?"" said the curate, standing up beside me.
36	
36	""Heaven knows!"" said I.
36	
36	A bat flickered by and vanished.  A distant tumult of shouting
36	began and ceased.  I looked again at the Martian, and saw he was now
36	moving eastward along the riverbank, with a swift, rolling motion.
36	
36	Every moment I expected the fire of some hidden battery to spring
36	upon him; but the evening calm was unbroken.  The figure of the Martian
36	grew smaller as he receded, and presently the mist and the gathering
36	night had swallowed him up.  By a common impulse we clambered higher.
36	Towards Sunbury was a dark appearance, as though a conical hill had
36	suddenly come into being there, hiding our view of the farther
36	country; and then, remoter across the river, over Walton, we saw
36	another such summit.  These hill-like forms grew lower and broader
36	even as we stared.
36	
36	Moved by a sudden thought, I looked northward, and there I
36	perceived a third of these cloudy black kopjes had risen.
36	
36	Everything had suddenly become very still.  Far away to the
36	southeast, marking the quiet, we heard the Martians hooting to one
36	another, and then the air quivered again with the distant thud of
36	their guns.  But the earthly artillery made no reply.
36	
36	Now at the time we could not understand these things, but later I
36	was to learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered in the
36	twilight.  Each of the Martians, standing in the great crescent I have
36	described, had discharged, by means of the gunlike tube he carried, a
36	huge canister over whatever hill, copse, cluster of houses, or other
36	possible cover for guns, chanced to be in front of him.  Some fired
36	only one of these, some two--as in the case of the one we had seen;
36	the one at Ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five at
36	that time.  These canisters smashed on striking the ground--they did
36	not explode--and incontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy,
36	inky vapour, coiling and pouring upward in a huge and ebony cumulus
36	cloud, a gaseous hill that sank and spread itself slowly over the
36	surrounding country.  And the touch of that vapour, the inhaling of
36	its pungent wisps, was death to all that breathes.
36	
36	It was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the densest smoke, so that,
36	after the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact, it sank
36	down through the air and poured over the ground in a manner rather
36	liquid than gaseous, abandoning the hills, and streaming into the
36	valleys and ditches and watercourses even as I have heard the
36	carbonic-acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do.  And
36	where it came upon water some chemical action occurred, and the
36	surface would be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank
36	slowly and made way for more.  The scum was absolutely insoluble, and
36	it is a strange thing, seeing the instant effect of the gas, that one
36	could drink without hurt the water from which it had been strained.
36	The vapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do.  It hung together
36	in banks, flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving
36	reluctantly before the wind, and very slowly it combined with the mist
36	and moisture of the air, and sank to the earth in the form of dust.
36	Save that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in the blue
36	of the spectrum is concerned, we are still entirely ignorant of the
36	nature of this substance.
36	
36	Once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over, the black
36	smoke clung so closely to the ground, even before its precipitation,
36	that fifty feet up in the air, on the roofs and upper stories of high
36	houses and on great trees, there was a chance of escaping its poison
36	altogether, as was proved even that night at Street Cobham and Ditton.
36	
36	The man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story of
36	the strangeness of its coiling flow, and how he looked down from the
36	church spire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts out
36	of its inky nothingness.  For a day and a half he remained there,
36	weary, starving and sun-scorched, the earth under the blue sky and
36	against the prospect of the distant hills a velvet-black expanse, with
36	red roofs, green trees, and, later, black-veiled shrubs and gates,
36	barns, outhouses, and walls, rising here and there into the sunlight.
36	
36	But that was at Street Cobham, where the black vapour was allowed
36	to remain until it sank of its own accord into the ground.  As a rule
36	the Martians, when it had served its purpose, cleared the air of it
36	again by wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it.
36	
36	This they did with the vapour banks near us, as we saw in the
36	starlight from the window of a deserted house at Upper Halliford,
36	whither we had returned.  From there we could see the searchlights on
36	Richmond Hill and Kingston Hill going to and fro, and about eleven the
36	windows rattled, and we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that
36	had been put in position there.  These continued intermittently for
36	the space of a quarter of an hour, sending chance shots at the
36	invisible Martians at Hampton and Ditton, and then the pale beams of
36	the electric light vanished, and were replaced by a bright red glow.
36	
36	Then the fourth cylinder fell--a brilliant green meteor--as I
36	learned afterwards, in Bushey Park.  Before the guns on the Richmond
36	and Kingston line of hills began, there was a fitful cannonade far
36	away in the southwest, due, I believe, to guns being fired haphazard
36	before the black vapour could overwhelm the gunners.
36	
36	So, setting about it as methodically as men might smoke out a
36	wasps' nest, the Martians spread this strange stifling vapour over the
36	Londonward country.  The horns of the crescent slowly moved apart,
36	until at last they formed a line from Hanwell to Coombe and Malden.
36	All night through their destructive tubes advanced.  Never once, after
36	the Martian at St. George's Hill was brought down, did they give the
36	artillery the ghost of a chance against them.  Wherever there was a
36	possibility of guns being laid for them unseen, a fresh canister of
36	the black vapour was discharged, and where the guns were openly
36	displayed the Heat-Ray was brought to bear.
36	
36	By midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of Richmond Park and
36	the glare of Kingston Hill threw their light upon a network of black
36	smoke, blotting out the whole valley of the Thames and extending as
36	far as the eye could reach.  And through this two Martians slowly
36	waded, and turned their hissing steam jets this way and that.
36	
36	They were sparing of the Heat-Ray that night, either because they
36	had but a limited supply of material for its production or because
36	they did not wish to destroy the country but only to crush and overawe
36	the opposition they had aroused.  In the latter aim they certainly
36	succeeded.  Sunday night was the end of the organised opposition to
36	their movements.  After that no body of men would stand against them,
36	so hopeless was the enterprise.  Even the crews of the torpedo-boats
36	and destroyers that had brought their quick-firers up the Thames
36	refused to stop, mutinied, and went down again.  The only offensive
36	operation men ventured upon after that night was the preparation of
36	mines and pitfalls, and even in that their energies were frantic and
36	spasmodic.
36	
36	One has to imagine, as well as one may, the fate of those batteries
36	towards Esher, waiting so tensely in the twilight.  Survivors there
36	were none.  One may picture the orderly expectation, the officers
36	alert and watchful, the gunners ready, the ammunition piled to hand,
36	the limber gunners with their horses and waggons, the groups of
36	civilian spectators standing as near as they were permitted, the
36	evening stillness, the ambulances and hospital tents with the burned
36	and wounded from Weybridge; then the dull resonance of the shots the
36	Martians fired, and the clumsy projectile whirling over the trees and
36	houses and smashing amid the neighbouring fields.
36	
36	One may picture, too, the sudden shifting of the attention, the
36	swiftly spreading coils and bellyings of that blackness advancing
36	headlong, towering heavenward, turning the twilight to a palpable
36	darkness, a strange and horrible antagonist of vapour striding upon
36	its victims, men and horses near it seen dimly, running, shrieking,
36	falling headlong, shouts of dismay, the guns suddenly abandoned, men
36	choking and writhing on the ground, and the swift broadening-out of
36	the opaque cone of smoke.  And then night and extinction--nothing but
36	a silent mass of impenetrable vapour hiding its dead.
36	
36	Before dawn the black vapour was pouring through the streets of
36	Richmond, and the disintegrating organism of government was, with a
36	last expiring effort, rousing the population of London to the
36	necessity of flight.

36	
36	CHAPTER SIXTEEN
36	
36	THE EXODUS FROM LONDON
36	
36	
36	So you understand the roaring wave of fear that swept through the
36	greatest city in the world just as Monday was dawning--the stream of
36	flight rising swiftly to a torrent, lashing in a foaming tumult round
36	the railway stations, banked up into a horrible struggle about the
36	shipping in the Thames, and hurrying by every available channel
36	northward and eastward.  By ten o'clock the police organisation, and
36	by midday even the railway organisations, were losing coherency,
36	losing shape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last in
36	that swift liquefaction of the social body.
36	
36	All the railway lines north of the Thames and the South-Eastern
36	people at Cannon Street had been warned by midnight on Sunday, and
36	trains were being filled.  People were fighting savagely for
36	standing-room in the carriages even at two o'clock.  By three, people
36	were being trampled and crushed even in Bishopsgate Street, a couple
36	of hundred yards or more from Liverpool Street station; revolvers were
36	fired, people stabbed, and the policemen who had been sent to direct
36	the traffic, exhausted and infuriated, were breaking the heads of the
36	people they were called out to protect.
36	
36	And as the day advanced and the engine drivers and stokers refused
36	to return to London, the pressure of the flight drove the people in an
36	ever-thickening multitude away from the stations and along the
36	northward-running roads.  By midday a Martian had been seen at Barnes,
36	and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the Thames and
36	across the flats of Lambeth, cutting off all escape over the bridges
36	in its sluggish advance.  Another bank drove over Ealing, and
36	surrounded a little island of survivors on Castle Hill, alive, but
36	unable to escape.
36	
36	After a fruitless struggle to get aboard a North-Western train at
36	Chalk Farm--the engines of the trains that had loaded in the goods
36	yard there _ploughed_ through shrieking people, and a dozen stalwart men
36	fought to keep the crowd from crushing the driver against his
36	furnace--my brother emerged upon the Chalk Farm road, dodged across
36	through a hurrying swarm of vehicles, and had the luck to be foremost
36	in the sack of a cycle shop.  The front tire of the machine he got was
36	punctured in dragging it through the window, but he got up and off,
36	notwithstanding, with no further injury than a cut wrist.  The steep
36	foot of Haverstock Hill was impassable owing to several overturned
36	horses, and my brother struck into Belsize Road.
36	
36	So he got out of the fury of the panic, and, skirting the Edgware
36	Road, reached Edgware about seven, fasting and wearied, but well ahead
36	of the crowd.  Along the road people were standing in the roadway,
36	curious, wondering.  He was passed by a number of cyclists, some
36	horsemen, and two motor cars.  A mile from Edgware the rim of the
36	wheel broke, and the machine became unridable.  He left it by the
36	roadside and trudged through the village.  There were shops half
36	opened in the main street of the place, and people crowded on the
36	pavement and in the doorways and windows, staring astonished at this
36	extraordinary procession of fugitives that was beginning.  He
36	succeeded in getting some food at an inn.
36	
36	For a time he remained in Edgware not knowing what next to do.  The
36	flying people increased in number.  Many of them, like my brother,
36	seemed inclined to loiter in the place.  There was no fresh news of
36	the invaders from Mars.
36	
36	At that time the road was crowded, but as yet far from congested.
36	Most of the fugitives at that hour were mounted on cycles, but there
36	were soon motor cars, hansom cabs, and carriages hurrying along, and
36	the dust hung in heavy clouds along the road to St. Albans.
36	
36	It was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to Chelmsford, where
36	some friends of his lived, that at last induced my brother to strike
36	into a quiet lane running eastward.  Presently he came upon a stile,
36	and, crossing it, followed a footpath northeastward.  He passed near
36	several farmhouses and some little places whose names he did not
36	learn.  He saw few fugitives until, in a grass lane towards High
36	Barnet, he happened upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers.
36	He came upon them just in time to save them.
36	
36	He heard their screams, and, hurrying round the corner, saw a
36	couple of men struggling to drag them out of the little pony-chaise in
36	which they had been driving, while a third with difficulty held the
36	frightened pony's head.  One of the ladies, a short woman dressed in
36	white, was simply screaming; the other, a dark, slender figure,
36	slashed at the man who gripped her arm with a whip she held in her
36	disengaged hand.
36	
36	My brother immediately grasped the situation, shouted, and hurried
36	towards the struggle.  One of the men desisted and turned towards him,
36	and my brother, realising from his antagonist's face that a fight was
36	unavoidable, and being an expert boxer, went into him forthwith and
36	sent him down against the wheel of the chaise.
36	
36	It was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him
36	quiet with a kick, and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the
36	slender lady's arm.  He heard the clatter of hoofs, the whip stung
36	across his face, a third antagonist struck him between the eyes, and
36	the man he held wrenched himself free and made off down the lane in
36	the direction from which he had come.
36	
36	Partly stunned, he found himself facing the man who had held the
36	horse's head, and became aware of the chaise receding from him down
36	the lane, swaying from side to side, and with the women in it looking
36	back.  The man before him, a burly rough, tried to close, and he
36	stopped him with a blow in the face.  Then, realising that he was
36	deserted, he dodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise,
36	with the sturdy man close behind him, and the fugitive, who had turned
36	now, following remotely.
36	
36	Suddenly he stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong,
36	and he rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists
36	again.  He would have had little chance against them had not the
36	slender lady very pluckily pulled up and returned to his help.  It
36	seems she had had a revolver all this time, but it had been under the
36	seat when she and her companion were attacked.  She fired at six
36	yards' distance, narrowly missing my brother.  The less courageous of
36	the robbers made off, and his companion followed him, cursing his
36	cowardice.  They both stopped in sight down the lane, where the third
36	man lay insensible.
36	
36	""Take this!"" said the slender lady, and she gave my brother her
36	revolver.
36	
36	""Go back to the chaise,"" said my brother, wiping the blood from his
36	split lip.
36	
36	She turned without a word--they were both panting--and they went
36	back to where the lady in white struggled to hold back the frightened
36	pony.
36	
36	The robbers had evidently had enough of it.  When my brother looked
36	again they were retreating.
36	
36	""I'll sit here,"" said my brother, ""if I may""; and he got upon the
36	empty front seat.  The lady looked over her shoulder.
36	
36	""Give me the reins,"" she said, and laid the whip along the pony's
36	side.  In another moment a bend in the road hid the three men from my
36	brother's eyes.
36	
36	So, quite unexpectedly, my brother found himself, panting, with a
36	cut mouth, a bruised jaw, and bloodstained knuckles, driving along an
36	unknown lane with these two women.
36	
36	He learned they were the wife and the younger sister of a surgeon
36	living at Stanmore, who had come in the small hours from a dangerous
36	case at Pinner, and heard at some railway station on his way of the
36	Martian advance.  He had hurried home, roused the women--their servant
36	had left them two days before--packed some provisions, put his
36	revolver under the seat--luckily for my brother--and told them to
36	drive on to Edgware, with the idea of getting a train there.  He
36	stopped behind to tell the neighbours.  He would overtake them, he
36	said, at about half past four in the morning, and now it was nearly
36	nine and they had seen nothing of him.  They could not stop in Edgware
36	because of the growing traffic through the place, and so they had come
36	into this side lane.
36	
36	That was the story they told my brother in fragments when presently
36	they stopped again, nearer to New Barnet.  He promised to stay with
36	them, at least until they could determine what to do, or until the
36	missing man arrived, and professed to be an expert shot with the
36	revolver--a weapon strange to him--in order to give them confidence.
36	
36	They made a sort of encampment by the wayside, and the pony became
36	happy in the hedge.  He told them of his own escape out of London, and
36	all that he knew of these Martians and their ways.  The sun crept
36	higher in the sky, and after a time their talk died out and gave place
36	to an uneasy state of anticipation.  Several wayfarers came along the
36	lane, and of these my brother gathered such news as he could.  Every
36	broken answer he had deepened his impression of the great disaster
36	that had come on humanity, deepened his persuasion of the immediate
36	necessity for prosecuting this flight.  He urged the matter upon them.
36	
36	""We have money,"" said the slender woman, and hesitated.
36	
36	Her eyes met my brother's, and her hesitation ended.
36	
36	""So have I,"" said my brother.
36	
36	She explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in gold,
36	besides a five-pound note, and suggested that with that they might get
36	upon a train at St. Albans or New Barnet.  My brother thought that was
36	hopeless, seeing the fury of the Londoners to crowd upon the trains,
36	and broached his own idea of striking across Essex towards Harwich and
36	thence escaping from the country altogether.
36	
36	Mrs. Elphinstone--that was the name of the woman in white--would
36	listen to no reasoning, and kept calling upon ""George""; but her
36	sister-in-law was astonishingly quiet and deliberate, and at last
36	agreed to my brother's suggestion.  So, designing to cross the Great
36	North Road, they went on towards Barnet, my brother leading the pony
36	to save it as much as possible.  As the sun crept up the sky the day
36	became excessively hot, and under foot a thick, whitish sand grew
36	burning and blinding, so that they travelled only very slowly.  The
36	hedges were grey with dust.  And as they advanced towards Barnet a
36	tumultuous murmuring grew stronger.
36	
36	They began to meet more people.  For the most part these were
36	staring before them, murmuring indistinct questions, jaded, haggard,
36	unclean.  One man in evening dress passed them on foot, his eyes on
36	the ground.  They heard his voice, and, looking back at him, saw one
36	hand clutched in his hair and the other beating invisible things.  His
36	paroxysm of rage over, he went on his way without once looking back.
36	
36	As my brother's party went on towards the crossroads to the south
36	of Barnet they saw a woman approaching the road across some fields on
36	their left, carrying a child and with two other children; and then
36	passed a man in dirty black, with a thick stick in one hand and a
36	small portmanteau in the other.  Then round the corner of the lane,
36	from between the villas that guarded it at its confluence with the
36	high road, came a little cart drawn by a sweating black pony and
36	driven by a sallow youth in a bowler hat, grey with dust.  There were
36	three girls, East End factory girls, and a couple of little children
36	crowded in the cart.
36	
36	""This'll tike us rahnd Edgware?"" asked the driver, wild-eyed,
36	white-faced; and when my brother told him it would if he turned to the
36	left, he whipped up at once without the formality of thanks.
36	
36	My brother noticed a pale grey smoke or haze rising among the
36	houses in front of them, and veiling the white facade of a terrace
36	beyond the road that appeared between the backs of the villas.  Mrs.
36	Elphinstone suddenly cried out at a number of tongues of smoky red
36	flame leaping up above the houses in front of them against the hot,
36	blue sky.  The tumultuous noise resolved itself now into the
36	disorderly mingling of many voices, the gride of many wheels, the
36	creaking of waggons, and the staccato of hoofs.  The lane came round
36	sharply not fifty yards from the crossroads.
36	
36	""Good heavens!"" cried Mrs. Elphinstone.  ""What is this you are
36	driving us into?""
36	
36	My brother stopped.
36	
36	For the main road was a boiling stream of people, a torrent of
36	human beings rushing northward, one pressing on another.  A great bank
36	of dust, white and luminous in the blaze of the sun, made everything
36	within twenty feet of the ground grey and indistinct and was
36	perpetually renewed by the hurrying feet of a dense crowd of horses
36	and of men and women on foot, and by the wheels of vehicles of every
36	description.
36	
36	""Way!"" my brother heard voices crying.  ""Make way!""
36	
36	It was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meeting
36	point of the lane and road; the crowd roared like a fire, and the dust
36	was hot and pungent.  And, indeed, a little way up the road a villa
36	was burning and sending rolling masses of black smoke across the road
36	to add to the confusion.
36	
36	Two men came past them.  Then a dirty woman, carrying a heavy
36	bundle and weeping.  A lost retriever dog, with hanging tongue,
36	circled dubiously round them, scared and wretched, and fled at my
36	brother's threat.
36	
36	So much as they could see of the road Londonward between the houses
36	to the right was a tumultuous stream of dirty, hurrying people, pent
36	in between the villas on either side; the black heads, the crowded
36	forms, grew into distinctness as they rushed towards the corner,
36	hurried past, and merged their individuality again in a receding
36	multitude that was swallowed up at last in a cloud of dust.
36	
36	""Go on!  Go on!"" cried the voices.  ""Way!  Way!""
36	
36	One man's hands pressed on the back of another.  My brother stood
36	at the pony's head.  Irresistibly attracted, he advanced slowly, pace
36	by pace, down the lane.
36	
36	Edgware had been a scene of confusion, Chalk Farm a riotous tumult,
36	but this was a whole population in movement.  It is hard to imagine
36	that host.  It had no character of its own.  The figures poured out
36	past the corner, and receded with their backs to the group in the
36	lane.  Along the margin came those who were on foot threatened by the
36	wheels, stumbling in the ditches, blundering into one another.
36	
36	The carts and carriages crowded close upon one another, making
36	little way for those swifter and more impatient vehicles that darted
36	forward every now and then when an opportunity showed itself of doing
36	so, sending the people scattering against the fences and gates of the
36	villas.
36	
36	""Push on!"" was the cry.  ""Push on!  They are coming!""
36	
36	In one cart stood a blind man in the uniform of the Salvation Army,
36	gesticulating with his crooked fingers and bawling, ""Eternity!
36	Eternity!""  His voice was hoarse and very loud so that my brother
36	could hear him long after he was lost to sight in the dust.  Some of
36	the people who crowded in the carts whipped stupidly at their horses
36	and quarrelled with other drivers; some sat motionless, staring at
36	nothing with miserable eyes; some gnawed their hands with thirst, or
36	lay prostrate in the bottoms of their conveyances.  The horses' bits
36	were covered with foam, their eyes bloodshot.
36	
36	There were cabs, carriages, shop cars, waggons, beyond counting; a
36	mail cart, a road-cleaner's cart marked ""Vestry of St. Pancras,"" a
36	huge timber waggon crowded with roughs.  A brewer's dray rumbled by
36	with its two near wheels splashed with fresh blood.
36	
36	""Clear the way!"" cried the voices.  ""Clear the way!""
36	
36	""Eter-nity!  Eter-nity!"" came echoing down the road.
36	
36	There were sad, haggard women tramping by, well dressed, with
36	children that cried and stumbled, their dainty clothes smothered in
36	dust, their weary faces smeared with tears.  With many of these came
36	men, sometimes helpful, sometimes lowering and savage.  Fighting side
36	by side with them pushed some weary street outcast in faded black
36	rags, wide-eyed, loud-voiced, and foul-mouthed.  There were sturdy
36	workmen thrusting their way along, wretched, unkempt men, clothed like
36	clerks or shopmen, struggling spasmodically; a wounded soldier my
36	brother noticed, men dressed in the clothes of railway porters, one
36	wretched creature in a nightshirt with a coat thrown over it.
36	
36	But varied as its composition was, certain things all that host had
36	in common.  There were fear and pain on their faces, and fear behind
36	them.  A tumult up the road, a quarrel for a place in a waggon, sent
36	the whole host of them quickening their pace; even a man so scared and
36	broken that his knees bent under him was galvanised for a moment into
36	renewed activity.  The heat and dust had already been at work upon
36	this multitude.  Their skins were dry, their lips black and cracked.
36	They were all thirsty, weary, and footsore.  And amid the various
36	cries one heard disputes, reproaches, groans of weariness and fatigue;
36	the voices of most of them were hoarse and weak.  Through it all ran a
36	refrain:
36	
36	""Way!  Way!  The Martians are coming!""
36	
36	Few stopped and came aside from that flood.  The lane opened
36	slantingly into the main road with a narrow opening, and had a
36	delusive appearance of coming from the direction of London.  Yet a
36	kind of eddy of people drove into its mouth; weaklings elbowed out of
36	the stream, who for the most part rested but a moment before plunging
36	into it again.  A little way down the lane, with two friends bending
36	over him, lay a man with a bare leg, wrapped about with bloody rags.
36	He was a lucky man to have friends.
36	
36	A little old man, with a grey military moustache and a filthy black
36	frock coat, limped out and sat down beside the trap, removed his
36	boot--his sock was blood-stained--shook out a pebble, and hobbled on
36	again; and then a little girl of eight or nine, all alone, threw
36	herself under the hedge close by my brother, weeping.
36	
36	""I can't go on!  I can't go on!""
36	
36	My brother woke from his torpor of astonishment and lifted her up,
36	speaking gently to her, and carried her to Miss Elphinstone.  So soon
36	as my brother touched her she became quite still, as if frightened.
36	
36	""Ellen!"" shrieked a woman in the crowd, with tears in her
36	voice--""Ellen!""  And the child suddenly darted away from my brother,
36	crying ""Mother!""
36	
36	""They are coming,"" said a man on horseback, riding past along the
36	lane.
36	
36	""Out of the way, there!"" bawled a coachman, towering high; and my
36	brother saw a closed carriage turning into the lane.
36	
36	The people crushed back on one another to avoid the horse.  My
36	brother pushed the pony and chaise back into the hedge, and the man
36	drove by and stopped at the turn of the way.  It was a carriage, with
36	a pole for a pair of horses, but only one was in the traces.  My
36	brother saw dimly through the dust that two men lifted out something
36	on a white stretcher and put it gently on the grass beneath the privet
36	hedge.
36	
36	One of the men came running to my brother.
36	
36	""Where is there any water?"" he said.  ""He is dying fast, and very
36	thirsty.  It is Lord Garrick.""
36	
36	""Lord Garrick!"" said my brother; ""the Chief Justice?""
36	
36	""The water?"" he said.
36	
36	""There may be a tap,"" said my brother, ""in some of the houses.  We
36	have no water.  I dare not leave my people.""
36	
36	The man pushed against the crowd towards the gate of the corner
36	house.
36	
36	""Go on!"" said the people, thrusting at him.  ""They are coming!  Go
36	on!""
36	
36	Then my brother's attention was distracted by a bearded, eagle-faced
36	man lugging a small handbag, which split even as my brother's
36	eyes rested on it and disgorged a mass of sovereigns that seemed to
36	break up into separate coins as it struck the ground.  They rolled
36	hither and thither among the struggling feet of men and horses.  The
36	man stopped and looked stupidly at the heap, and the shaft of a cab
36	struck his shoulder and sent him reeling.  He gave a shriek and dodged
36	back, and a cartwheel shaved him narrowly.
36	
36	""Way!"" cried the men all about him.  ""Make way!""
36	
36	So soon as the cab had passed, he flung himself, with both hands
36	open, upon the heap of coins, and began thrusting handfuls in his
36	pocket.  A horse rose close upon him, and in another moment, half
36	rising, he had been borne down under the horse's hoofs.
36	
36	""Stop!"" screamed my brother, and pushing a woman out of his way,
36	tried to clutch the bit of the horse.
36	
36	Before he could get to it, he heard a scream under the wheels, and
36	saw through the dust the rim passing over the poor wretch's back.  The
36	driver of the cart slashed his whip at my brother, who ran round
36	behind the cart.  The multitudinous shouting confused his ears.  The
36	man was writhing in the dust among his scattered money, unable to
36	rise, for the wheel had broken his back, and his lower limbs lay limp
36	and dead.  My brother stood up and yelled at the next driver, and a
36	man on a black horse came to his assistance.
36	
36	""Get him out of the road,"" said he; and, clutching the man's collar
36	with his free hand, my brother lugged him sideways.  But he still
36	clutched after his money, and regarded my brother fiercely, hammering
36	at his arm with a handful of gold.  ""Go on!  Go on!"" shouted angry
36	voices behind.
36	
36	""Way!  Way!""
36	
36	There was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into the cart
36	that the man on horseback stopped.  My brother looked up, and the man
36	with the gold twisted his head round and bit the wrist that held his
36	collar.  There was a concussion, and the black horse came staggering
36	sideways, and the carthorse pushed beside it.  A hoof missed my
36	brother's foot by a hair's breadth.  He released his grip on the
36	fallen man and jumped back.  He saw anger change to terror on the face
36	of the poor wretch on the ground, and in a moment he was hidden and my
36	brother was borne backward and carried past the entrance of the lane,
36	and had to fight hard in the torrent to recover it.
36	
36	He saw Miss Elphinstone covering her eyes, and a little child, with
36	all a child's want of sympathetic imagination, staring with dilated
36	eyes at a dusty something that lay black and still, ground and crushed
36	under the rolling wheels.  ""Let us go back!"" he shouted, and began
36	turning the pony round. ""We cannot cross this--hell,"" he said and they
36	went back a hundred yards the way they had come, until the fighting
36	crowd was hidden.  As they passed the bend in the lane my brother saw
36	the face of the dying man in the ditch under the privet, deadly white
36	and drawn, and shining with perspiration.  The two women sat silent,
36	crouching in their seat and shivering.
36	
36	Then beyond the bend my brother stopped again.  Miss Elphinstone
36	was white and pale, and her sister-in-law sat weeping, too wretched
36	even to call upon ""George.""  My brother was horrified and perplexed.
36	So soon as they had retreated he realised how urgent and unavoidable
36	it was to attempt this crossing.  He turned to Miss Elphinstone,
36	suddenly resolute.
36	
36	""We must go that way,"" he said, and led the pony round again.
36	
36	For the second time that day this girl proved her quality.  To force
36	their way into the torrent of people, my brother plunged into the
36	traffic and held back a cab horse, while she drove the pony across its
36	head.  A waggon locked wheels for a moment and ripped a long splinter
36	from the chaise.  In another moment they were caught and swept forward
36	by the stream.  My brother, with the cabman's whip marks red across
36	his face and hands, scrambled into the chaise and took the reins from
36	her.
36	
36	""Point the revolver at the man behind,"" he said, giving it to her,
36	""if he presses us too hard.  No!--point it at his horse.""
36	
36	Then he began to look out for a chance of edging to the right
36	across the road.  But once in the stream he seemed to lose volition,
36	to become a part of that dusty rout.  They swept through Chipping
36	Barnet with the torrent; they were nearly a mile beyond the centre of
36	the town before they had fought across to the opposite side of the
36	way.  It was din and confusion indescribable; but in and beyond the
36	town the road forks repeatedly, and this to some extent relieved the
36	stress.
36	
36	They struck eastward through Hadley, and there on either side of
36	the road, and at another place farther on they came upon a great
36	multitude of people drinking at the stream, some fighting to come at
36	the water.  And farther on, from a lull near East Barnet, they saw
36	two trains running slowly one after the other without signal or
36	order--trains swarming with people, with men even among the coals
36	behind the engines--going northward along the Great Northern Railway.
36	My brother supposes they must have filled outside London, for at that
36	time the furious terror of the people had rendered the central
36	termini impossible.
36	
36	Near this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon, for the
36	violence of the day had already utterly exhausted all three of them.
36	They began to suffer the beginnings of hunger; the night was cold, and
36	none of them dared to sleep.  And in the evening many people came
36	hurrying along the road nearby their stopping place, fleeing from
36	unknown dangers before them, and going in the direction from which my
36	brother had come.
36

36	
36	CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
36	
36	THE ""THUNDER CHILD""
36	
36	
36	Had the Martians aimed only at destruction, they might on Monday
36	have annihilated the entire population of London, as it spread itself
36	slowly through the home counties.  Not only along the road through
36	Barnet, but also through Edgware and Waltham Abbey, and along the
36	roads eastward to Southend and Shoeburyness, and south of the Thames
36	to Deal and Broadstairs, poured the same frantic rout.  If one could
36	have hung that June morning in a balloon in the blazing blue above
36	London every northward and eastward road running out of the tangled
36	maze of streets would have seemed stippled black with the streaming
36	fugitives, each dot a human agony of terror and physical distress.  I
36	have set forth at length in the last chapter my brother's account of
36	the road through Chipping Barnet, in order that my readers may realise
36	how that swarming of black dots appeared to one of those concerned.
36	Never before in the history of the world had such a mass of human
36	beings moved and suffered together.  The legendary hosts of Goths and
36	Huns, the hugest armies Asia has ever seen, would have been but a drop
36	in that current.  And this was no disciplined march; it was a
36	stampede--a stampede gigantic and terrible--without order and without
36	a goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned, driving
36	headlong.  It was the beginning of the rout of civilisation, of the
36	massacre of mankind.
36	
36	Directly below him the balloonist would have seen the network of
36	streets far and wide, houses, churches, squares, crescents,
36	gardens--already derelict--spread out like a huge map, and in the
36	southward _blotted_.  Over Ealing, Richmond, Wimbledon, it would
36	have seemed as if some monstrous pen had flung ink upon the chart.
36	Steadily, incessantly, each black splash grew and spread, shooting out
36	ramifications this way and that, now banking itself against rising
36	ground, now pouring swiftly over a crest into a new-found valley,
36	exactly as a gout of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper.
36	
36	And beyond, over the blue hills that rise southward of the river,
36	the glittering Martians went to and fro, calmly and methodically
36	spreading their poison cloud over this patch of country and then over
36	that, laying it again with their steam jets when it had served its
36	purpose, and taking possession of the conquered country.  They do not
36	seem to have aimed at extermination so much as at complete
36	demoralisation and the destruction of any opposition.  They exploded
36	any stores of powder they came upon, cut every telegraph, and wrecked
36	the railways here and there.  They were hamstringing mankind.  They
36	seemed in no hurry to extend the field of their operations, and did
36	not come beyond the central part of London all that day.  It is
36	possible that a very considerable number of people in London stuck to
36	their houses through Monday morning.  Certain it is that many died at
36	home suffocated by the Black Smoke.
36	
36	Until about midday the Pool of London was an astonishing scene.
36	Steamboats and shipping of all sorts lay there, tempted by the
36	enormous sums of money offered by fugitives, and it is said that many
36	who swam out to these vessels were thrust off with boathooks and
36	drowned.  About one o'clock in the afternoon the thinning remnant of a
36	cloud of the black vapour appeared between the arches of Blackfriars
36	Bridge.  At that the Pool became a scene of mad confusion, fighting,
36	and collision, and for some time a multitude of boats and barges
36	jammed in the northern arch of the Tower Bridge, and the sailors and
36	lightermen had to fight savagely against the people who swarmed upon
36	them from the riverfront.  People were actually clambering down the
36	piers of the bridge from above.
36	
36	When, an hour later, a Martian appeared beyond the Clock Tower and
36	waded down the river, nothing but wreckage floated above Limehouse.
36	
36	Of the falling of the fifth cylinder I have presently to tell.  The
36	sixth star fell at Wimbledon.  My brother, keeping watch beside the
36	women in the chaise in a meadow, saw the green flash of it far beyond
36	the hills.  On Tuesday the little party, still set upon getting across
36	the sea, made its way through the swarming country towards Colchester.
36	The news that the Martians were now in possession of the whole of
36	London was confirmed.  They had been seen at Highgate, and even, it
36	was said, at Neasden.  But they did not come into my brother's view
36	until the morrow.
36	
36	That day the scattered multitudes began to realise the urgent need
36	of provisions.  As they grew hungry the rights of property ceased to
36	be regarded.  Farmers were out to defend their cattle-sheds,
36	granaries, and ripening root crops with arms in their hands.  A number
36	of people now, like my brother, had their faces eastward, and there
36	were some desperate souls even going back towards London to get food.
36	These were chiefly people from the northern suburbs, whose knowledge
36	of the Black Smoke came by hearsay.  He heard that about half the
36	members of the government had gathered at Birmingham, and that
36	enormous quantities of high explosives were being prepared to be used
36	in automatic mines across the Midland counties.
36	
36	He was also told that the Midland Railway Company had replaced the
36	desertions of the first day's panic, had resumed traffic, and was
36	running northward trains from St. Albans to relieve the congestion of
36	the home counties.  There was also a placard in Chipping Ongar
36	announcing that large stores of flour were available in the northern
36	towns and that within twenty-four hours bread would be distributed
36	among the starving people in the neighbourhood.  But this intelligence
36	did not deter him from the plan of escape he had formed, and the three
36	pressed eastward all day, and heard no more of the bread distribution
36	than this promise.  Nor, as a matter of fact, did anyone else hear
36	more of it.  That night fell the seventh star, falling upon Primrose
36	Hill.  It fell while Miss Elphinstone was watching, for she took that
36	duty alternately with my brother.  She saw it.
36	
36	On Wednesday the three fugitives--they had passed the night in a
36	field of unripe wheat--reached Chelmsford, and there a body of the
36	inhabitants, calling itself the Committee of Public Supply, seized the
36	pony as provisions, and would give nothing in exchange for it but the
36	promise of a share in it the next day.  Here there were rumours of
36	Martians at Epping, and news of the destruction of Waltham Abbey
36	Powder Mills in a vain attempt to blow up one of the invaders.
36	
36	People were watching for Martians here from the church towers.  My
36	brother, very luckily for him as it chanced, preferred to push on at
36	once to the coast rather than wait for food, although all three of
36	them were very hungry.  By midday they passed through Tillingham,
36	which, strangely enough, seemed to be quite silent and deserted, save
36	for a few furtive plunderers hunting for food.  Near Tillingham they
36	suddenly came in sight of the sea, and the most amazing crowd of
36	shipping of all sorts that it is possible to imagine.
36	
36	For after the sailors could no longer come up the Thames, they came
36	on to the Essex coast, to Harwich and Walton and Clacton, and
36	afterwards to Foulness and Shoebury, to bring off the people.  They
36	lay in a huge sickle-shaped curve that vanished into mist at last
36	towards the Naze.  Close inshore was a multitude of fishing
36	smacks--English, Scotch, French, Dutch, and Swedish; steam launches
36	from the Thames, yachts, electric boats; and beyond were ships of large
36	burden, a multitude of filthy colliers, trim merchantmen, cattle ships,
36	passenger boats, petroleum tanks, ocean tramps, an old white transport
36	even, neat white and grey liners from Southampton and Hamburg; and
36	along the blue coast across the Blackwater my brother could make out
36	dimly a dense swarm of boats chaffering with the people on the beach,
36	a swarm which also extended up the Blackwater almost to Maldon.
36	
36	About a couple of miles out lay an ironclad, very low in the water,
36	almost, to my brother's perception, like a water-logged ship.  This
36	was the ram _Thunder Child_.  It was the only warship in sight, but far
36	away to the right over the smooth surface of the sea--for that day
36	there was a dead calm--lay a serpent of black smoke to mark the next
36	ironclads of the Channel Fleet, which hovered in an extended line,
36	steam up and ready for action, across the Thames estuary during the
36	course of the Martian conquest, vigilant and yet powerless to prevent
36	it.
36	
36	At the sight of the sea, Mrs. Elphinstone, in spite of the
36	assurances of her sister-in-law, gave way to panic.  She had never
36	been out of England before, she would rather die than trust herself
36	friendless in a foreign country, and so forth.  She seemed, poor woman,
36	to imagine that the French and the Martians might prove very similar.
36	She had been growing increasingly hysterical, fearful, and depressed
36	during the two days' journeyings.  Her great idea was to return to
36	Stanmore.  Things had been always well and safe at Stanmore.  They
36	would find George at Stanmore.
36	
36	It was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down to the
36	beach, where presently my brother succeeded in attracting the
36	attention of some men on a paddle steamer from the Thames.  They sent
36	a boat and drove a bargain for thirty-six pounds for the three.  The
36	steamer was going, these men said, to Ostend.
36	
36	It was about two o'clock when my brother, having paid their fares
36	at the gangway, found himself safely aboard the steamboat with his
36	charges.  There was food aboard, albeit at exorbitant prices, and the
36	three of them contrived to eat a meal on one of the seats forward.
36	
36	There were already a couple of score of passengers aboard, some of
36	whom had expended their last money in securing a passage, but the
36	captain lay off the Blackwater until five in the afternoon, picking up
36	passengers until the seated decks were even dangerously crowded.  He
36	would probably have remained longer had it not been for the sound of
36	guns that began about that hour in the south.  As if in answer, the
36	ironclad seaward fired a small gun and hoisted a string of flags.  A
36	jet of smoke sprang out of her funnels.
36	
36	Some of the passengers were of opinion that this firing came from
36	Shoeburyness, until it was noticed that it was growing louder.  At the
36	same time, far away in the southeast the masts and upperworks of three
36	ironclads rose one after the other out of the sea, beneath clouds of
36	black smoke.  But my brother's attention speedily reverted to the
36	distant firing in the south.  He fancied he saw a column of smoke
36	rising out of the distant grey haze.
36	
36	The little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big
36	crescent of shipping, and the low Essex coast was growing blue and
36	hazy, when a Martian appeared, small and faint in the remote distance,
36	advancing along the muddy coast from the direction of Foulness.  At
36	that the captain on the bridge swore at the top of his voice with fear
36	and anger at his own delay, and the paddles seemed infected with his
36	terror.  Every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats of
36	the steamer and stared at that distant shape, higher than the trees or
36	church towers inland, and advancing with a leisurely parody of a human
36	stride.
36	
36	It was the first Martian my brother had seen, and he stood, more
36	amazed than terrified, watching this Titan advancing deliberately
36	towards the shipping, wading farther and farther into the water as the
36	coast fell away.  Then, far away beyond the Crouch, came another,
36	striding over some stunted trees, and then yet another, still farther
36	off, wading deeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfway
36	up between sea and sky.  They were all stalking seaward, as if to
36	intercept the escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded
36	between Foulness and the Naze.  In spite of the throbbing exertions of
36	the engines of the little paddle-boat, and the pouring foam that her
36	wheels flung behind her, she receded with terrifying slowness from
36	this ominous advance.
36	
36	Glancing northwestward, my brother saw the large crescent of
36	shipping already writhing with the approaching terror; one ship
36	passing behind another, another coming round from broadside to end on,
36	steamships whistling and giving off volumes of steam, sails being let
36	out, launches rushing hither and thither.  He was so fascinated by
36	this and by the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes
36	for anything seaward.  And then a swift movement of the steamboat (she
36	had suddenly come round to avoid being run down) flung him headlong
36	from the seat upon which he was standing.  There was a shouting all
36	about him, a trampling of feet, and a cheer that seemed to be answered
36	faintly.  The steamboat lurched and rolled him over upon his hands.
36	
36	He sprang to his feet and saw to starboard, and not a hundred yards
36	from their heeling, pitching boat, a vast iron bulk like the blade of
36	a plough tearing through the water, tossing it on either side in huge
36	waves of foam that leaped towards the steamer, flinging her paddles
36	helplessly in the air, and then sucking her deck down almost to the
36	waterline.
36	
36	A douche of spray blinded my brother for a moment.  When his eyes
36	were clear again he saw the monster had passed and was rushing
36	landward.  Big iron upperworks rose out of this headlong structure,
36	and from that twin funnels projected and spat a smoking blast shot
36	with fire.  It was the torpedo ram, _Thunder Child_, steaming headlong,
36	coming to the rescue of the threatened shipping.
36	
36	Keeping his footing on the heaving deck by clutching the bulwarks,
36	my brother looked past this charging leviathan at the Martians again,
36	and he saw the three of them now close together, and standing so far
36	out to sea that their tripod supports were almost entirely submerged.
36	Thus sunken, and seen in remote perspective, they appeared far less
36	formidable than the huge iron bulk in whose wake the steamer was
36	pitching so helplessly.  It would seem they were regarding this new
36	antagonist with astonishment.  To their intelligence, it may be, the
36	giant was even such another as themselves.  The _Thunder Child_ fired no
36	gun, but simply drove full speed towards them.  It was probably her
36	not firing that enabled her to get so near the enemy as she did.  They
36	did not know what to make of her.  One shell, and they would have sent
36	her to the bottom forthwith with the Heat-Ray.
36	
36	She was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed halfway
36	between the steamboat and the Martians--a diminishing black bulk
36	against the receding horizontal expanse of the Essex coast.
36	
36	Suddenly the foremost Martian lowered his tube and discharged a
36	canister of the black gas at the ironclad.  It hit her larboard side
36	and glanced off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward, an
36	unfolding torrent of Black Smoke, from which the ironclad drove clear.
36	To the watchers from the steamer, low in the water and with the sun in
36	their eyes, it seemed as though she were already among the Martians.
36	
36	They saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of the water
36	as they retreated shoreward, and one of them raised the camera-like
36	generator of the Heat-Ray.  He held it pointing obliquely downward,
36	and a bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch.  It must have
36	driven through the iron of the ship's side like a white-hot iron rod
36	through paper.
36	
36	A flicker of flame went up through the rising steam, and then the
36	Martian reeled and staggered.  In another moment he was cut down, and
36	a great body of water and steam shot high in the air.  The guns of the
36	_Thunder Child_ sounded through the reek, going off one after the other,
36	and one shot splashed the water high close by the steamer, ricocheted
36	towards the other flying ships to the north, and smashed a smack to
36	matchwood.
36	
36	But no one heeded that very much.  At the sight of the Martian's
36	collapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticulately, and all the
36	crowding passengers on the steamer's stern shouted together.  And then
36	they yelled again.  For, surging out beyond the white tumult, drove
36	something long and black, the flames streaming from its middle parts,
36	its ventilators and funnels spouting fire.
36	
36	She was alive still; the steering gear, it seems, was intact and
36	her engines working.  She headed straight for a second Martian, and
36	was within a hundred yards of him when the Heat-Ray came to bear.  Then
36	with a violent thud, a blinding flash, her decks, her funnels, leaped
36	upward.  The Martian staggered with the violence of her explosion, and
36	in another moment the flaming wreckage, still driving forward with the
36	impetus of its pace, had struck him and crumpled him up like a thing
36	of cardboard.  My brother shouted involuntarily.  A boiling tumult of
36	steam hid everything again.
36	
36	""Two!"" yelled the captain.
36	
36	Everyone was shouting.  The whole steamer from end to end rang with
36	frantic cheering that was taken up first by one and then by all in the
36	crowding multitude of ships and boats that was driving out to sea.
36	
36	The steam hung upon the water for many minutes, hiding the third
36	Martian and the coast altogether.  And all this time the boat was
36	paddling steadily out to sea and away from the fight; and when at last
36	the confusion cleared, the drifting bank of black vapour intervened,
36	and nothing of the _Thunder Child_ could be made out, nor could the
36	third Martian be seen.  But the ironclads to seaward were now quite
36	close and standing in towards shore past the steamboat.
36	
36	The little vessel continued to beat its way seaward, and the
36	ironclads receded slowly towards the coast, which was hidden still by
36	a marbled bank of vapour, part steam, part black gas, eddying and
36	combining in the strangest way.  The fleet of refugees was scattering
36	to the northeast; several smacks were sailing between the ironclads
36	and the steamboat.  After a time, and before they reached the sinking
36	cloud bank, the warships turned northward, and then abruptly went
36	about and passed into the thickening haze of evening southward.  The
36	coast grew faint, and at last indistinguishable amid the low banks of
36	clouds that were gathering about the sinking sun.
36	
36	Then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the
36	vibration of guns, and a form of black shadows moving.  Everyone
36	struggled to the rail of the steamer and peered into the blinding
36	furnace of the west, but nothing was to be distinguished clearly.  A
36	mass of smoke rose slanting and barred the face of the sun.  The
36	steamboat throbbed on its way through an interminable suspense.
36	
36	The sun sank into grey clouds, the sky flushed and darkened, the
36	evening star trembled into sight.  It was deep twilight when the
36	captain cried out and pointed.  My brother strained his eyes.
36	Something rushed up into the sky out of the greyness--rushed
36	slantingly upward and very swiftly into the luminous clearness above
36	the clouds in the western sky; something flat and broad, and very
36	large, that swept round in a vast curve, grew smaller, sank slowly,
36	and vanished again into the grey mystery of the night.  And as it flew
36	it rained down darkness upon the land.

36	
36	BOOK TWO
36	
36	THE EARTH UNDER THE MARTIANS
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER ONE
36	
36	UNDER FOOT
36	
36	
36	In the first book I have wandered so much from my own adventures to
36	tell of the experiences of my brother that all through the last two
36	chapters I and the curate have been lurking in the empty house at
36	Halliford whither we fled to escape the Black Smoke.  There I will
36	resume.  We stopped there all Sunday night and all the next day--the
36	day of the panic--in a little island of daylight, cut off by the Black
36	Smoke from the rest of the world.  We could do nothing but wait in
36	aching inactivity during those two weary days.
36	
36	My mind was occupied by anxiety for my wife.  I figured her at
36	Leatherhead, terrified, in danger, mourning me already as a dead man.
36	I paced the rooms and cried aloud when I thought of how I was cut off
36	from her, of all that might happen to her in my absence.  My cousin I
36	knew was brave enough for any emergency, but he was not the sort of
36	man to realise danger quickly, to rise promptly.  What was needed now
36	was not bravery, but circumspection.  My only consolation was to
36	believe that the Martians were moving London-ward and away from her.
36	Such vague anxieties keep the mind sensitive and painful.  I grew very
36	weary and irritable with the curate's perpetual ejaculations; I tired
36	of the sight of his selfish despair.  After some ineffectual
36	remonstrance I kept away from him, staying in a room--evidently a
36	children's schoolroom--containing globes, forms, and copybooks.  When
36	he followed me thither, I went to a box room at the top of the house
36	and, in order to be alone with my aching miseries, locked myself in.
36	
36	We were hopelessly hemmed in by the Black Smoke all that day and
36	the morning of the next.  There were signs of people in the next house
36	on Sunday evening--a face at a window and moving lights, and later the
36	slamming of a door.  But I do not know who these people were, nor what
36	became of them.  We saw nothing of them next day.  The Black Smoke
36	drifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creeping nearer
36	and nearer to us, driving at last along the roadway outside the house
36	that hid us.
36	
36	A Martian came across the fields about midday, laying the stuff
36	with a jet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls, smashed
36	all the windows it touched, and scalded the curate's hand as he fled
36	out of the front room.  When at last we crept across the sodden rooms
36	and looked out again, the country northward was as though a black
36	snowstorm had passed over it.  Looking towards the river, we were
36	astonished to see an unaccountable redness mingling with the black of
36	the scorched meadows.
36	
36	For a time we did not see how this change affected our position,
36	save that we were relieved of our fear of the Black Smoke.  But later
36	I perceived that we were no longer hemmed in, that now we might get
36	away.  So soon as I realised that the way of escape was open, my dream
36	of action returned.  But the curate was lethargic, unreasonable.
36	
36	""We are safe here,"" he repeated; ""safe here.""
36	
36	I resolved to leave him--would that I had!  Wiser now for the
36	artilleryman's teaching, I sought out food and drink.  I had found oil
36	and rags for my burns, and I also took a hat and a flannel shirt that
36	I found in one of the bedrooms.  When it was clear to him that I meant
36	to go alone--had reconciled myself to going alone--he suddenly roused
36	himself to come.  And all being quiet throughout the afternoon, we
36	started about five o'clock, as I should judge, along the blackened
36	road to Sunbury.
36	
36	In Sunbury, and at intervals along the road, were dead bodies lying
36	in contorted attitudes, horses as well as men, overturned carts and
36	luggage, all covered thickly with black dust.  That pall of cindery
36	powder made me think of what I had read of the destruction of Pompeii.
36	We got to Hampton Court without misadventure, our minds full of
36	strange and unfamiliar appearances, and at Hampton Court our eyes were
36	relieved to find a patch of green that had escaped the suffocating
36	drift.  We went through Bushey Park, with its deer going to and fro
36	under the chestnuts, and some men and women hurrying in the distance
36	towards Hampton, and so we came to Twickenham.  These were the first
36	people we saw.
36	
36	Away across the road the woods beyond Ham and Petersham were still
36	afire.  Twickenham was uninjured by either Heat-Ray or Black Smoke,
36	and there were more people about here, though none could give us news.
36	For the most part they were like ourselves, taking advantage of a lull
36	to shift their quarters.  I have an impression that many of the houses
36	here were still occupied by scared inhabitants, too frightened even
36	for flight.  Here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant along
36	the road.  I remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap,
36	pounded into the road by the wheels of subsequent carts.  We crossed
36	Richmond Bridge about half past eight.  We hurried across the exposed
36	bridge, of course, but I noticed floating down the stream a number
36	of red masses, some many feet across.  I did not know what these
36	were--there was no time for scrutiny--and I put a more horrible
36	interpretation on them than they deserved.  Here again on the Surrey
36	side were black dust that had once been smoke, and dead bodies--a heap
36	near the approach to the station; but we had no glimpse of the
36	Martians until we were some way towards Barnes.
36	
36	We saw in the blackened distance a group of three people running
36	down a side street towards the river, but otherwise it seemed
36	deserted.  Up the hill Richmond town was burning briskly; outside the
36	town of Richmond there was no trace of the Black Smoke.
36	
36	Then suddenly, as we approached Kew, came a number of people
36	running, and the upperworks of a Martian fighting-machine loomed in
36	sight over the housetops, not a hundred yards away from us.  We stood
36	aghast at our danger, and had the Martian looked down we must
36	immediately have perished.  We were so terrified that we dared not go
36	on, but turned aside and hid in a shed in a garden.  There the curate
36	crouched, weeping silently, and refusing to stir again.
36	
36	But my fixed idea of reaching Leatherhead would not let me rest,
36	and in the twilight I ventured out again.  I went through a shrubbery,
36	and along a passage beside a big house standing in its own grounds,
36	and so emerged upon the road towards Kew.  The curate I left in the
36	shed, but he came hurrying after me.
36	
36	That second start was the most foolhardy thing I ever did.  For it
36	was manifest the Martians were about us.  No sooner had the curate
36	overtaken me than we saw either the fighting-machine we had seen
36	before or another, far away across the meadows in the direction of Kew
36	Lodge.  Four or five little black figures hurried before it across the
36	green-grey of the field, and in a moment it was evident this Martian
36	pursued them.  In three strides he was among them, and they ran
36	radiating from his feet in all directions.  He used no Heat-Ray to
36	destroy them, but picked them up one by one.  Apparently he tossed
36	them into the great metallic carrier which projected behind him, much
36	as a workman's basket hangs over his shoulder.
36	
36	It was the first time I realised that the Martians might have any
36	other purpose than destruction with defeated humanity.  We stood for a
36	moment petrified, then turned and fled through a gate behind us into a
36	walled garden, fell into, rather than found, a fortunate ditch, and
36	lay there, scarce daring to whisper to each other until the stars were
36	out.
36	
36	I suppose it was nearly eleven o'clock before we gathered courage
36	to start again, no longer venturing into the road, but sneaking along
36	hedgerows and through plantations, and watching keenly through the
36	darkness, he on the right and I on the left, for the Martians, who
36	seemed to be all about us.  In one place we blundered upon a scorched
36	and blackened area, now cooling and ashen, and a number of scattered
36	dead bodies of men, burned horribly about the heads and trunks but
36	with their legs and boots mostly intact; and of dead horses, fifty
36	feet, perhaps, behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun
36	carriages.
36	
36	Sheen, it seemed, had escaped destruction, but the place was silent
36	and deserted.  Here we happened on no dead, though the night was too
36	dark for us to see into the side roads of the place.  In Sheen my
36	companion suddenly complained of faintness and thirst, and we decided
36	to try one of the houses.
36	
36	The first house we entered, after a little difficulty with the
36	window, was a small semi-detached villa, and I found nothing eatable
36	left in the place but some mouldy cheese.  There was, however, water
36	to drink; and I took a hatchet, which promised to be useful in our
36	next house-breaking.
36	
36	We then crossed to a place where the road turns towards Mortlake.
36	Here there stood a white house within a walled garden, and in the
36	pantry of this domicile we found a store of food--two loaves of bread
36	in a pan, an uncooked steak, and the half of a ham.  I give this
36	catalogue so precisely because, as it happened, we were destined to
36	subsist upon this store for the next fortnight.  Bottled beer stood
36	under a shelf, and there were two bags of haricot beans and some limp
36	lettuces.  This pantry opened into a kind of wash-up kitchen, and in
36	this was firewood; there was also a cupboard, in which we found nearly
36	a dozen of burgundy, tinned soups and salmon, and two tins of
36	biscuits.
36	
36	We sat in the adjacent kitchen in the dark--for we dared not strike
36	a light--and ate bread and ham, and drank beer out of the same bottle.
36	The curate, who was still timorous and restless, was now, oddly
36	enough, for pushing on, and I was urging him to keep up his strength
36	by eating when the thing happened that was to imprison us.
36	
36	""It can't be midnight yet,"" I said, and then came a blinding glare
36	of vivid green light.  Everything in the kitchen leaped out, clearly
36	visible in green and black, and vanished again.  And then followed such
36	a concussion as I have never heard before or since.  So close on the
36	heels of this as to seem instantaneous came a thud behind me, a clash
36	of glass, a crash and rattle of falling masonry all about us, and the
36	plaster of the ceiling came down upon us, smashing into a multitude of
36	fragments upon our heads.  I was knocked headlong across the floor
36	against the oven handle and stunned.  I was insensible for a long
36	time, the curate told me, and when I came to we were in darkness
36	again, and he, with a face wet, as I found afterwards, with blood from
36	a cut forehead, was dabbing water over me.
36	
36	For some time I could not recollect what had happened.  Then things
36	came to me slowly.  A bruise on my temple asserted itself.
36	
36	""Are you better?"" asked the curate in a whisper.
36	
36	At last I answered him.  I sat up.
36	
36	""Don't move,"" he said.  ""The floor is covered with smashed crockery
36	from the dresser.  You can't possibly move without making a noise, and
36	I fancy _they_ are outside.""
36	
36	We both sat quite silent, so that we could scarcely hear each other
36	breathing.  Everything seemed deadly still, but once something near
36	us, some plaster or broken brickwork, slid down with a rumbling sound.
36	Outside and very near was an intermittent, metallic rattle.
36	
36	""That!"" said the curate, when presently it happened again.
36	
36	""Yes,"" I said.  ""But what is it?""
36	
36	""A Martian!"" said the curate.
36	
36	I listened again.
36	
36	""It was not like the Heat-Ray,"" I said, and for a time I was
36	inclined to think one of the great fighting-machines had stumbled
36	against the house, as I had seen one stumble against the tower of
36	Shepperton Church.
36	
36	Our situation was so strange and incomprehensible that for three or
36	four hours, until the dawn came, we scarcely moved.  And then the light
36	filtered in, not through the window, which remained black, but through
36	a triangular aperture between a beam and a heap of broken bricks in
36	the wall behind us.  The interior of the kitchen we now saw greyly for
36	the first time.
36	
36	The window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould, which
36	flowed over the table upon which we had been sitting and lay about our
36	feet.  Outside, the soil was banked high against the house.  At the
36	top of the window frame we could see an uprooted drainpipe.  The floor
36	was littered with smashed hardware; the end of the kitchen towards the
36	house was broken into, and since the daylight shone in there, it was
36	evident the greater part of the house had collapsed.  Contrasting
36	vividly with this ruin was the neat dresser, stained in the fashion,
36	pale green, and with a number of copper and tin vessels below it, the
36	wallpaper imitating blue and white tiles, and a couple of coloured
36	supplements fluttering from the walls above the kitchen range.
36	
36	As the dawn grew clearer, we saw through the gap in the wall the
36	body of a Martian, standing sentinel, I suppose, over the still
36	glowing cylinder.  At the sight of that we crawled as circumspectly as
36	possible out of the twilight of the kitchen into the darkness of the
36	scullery.
36	
36	Abruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind.
36	
36	""The fifth cylinder,"" I whispered, ""the fifth shot from Mars, has
36	struck this house and buried us under the ruins!""
36	
36	For a time the curate was silent, and then he whispered:
36	
36	""God have mercy upon us!""
36	
36	I heard him presently whimpering to himself.
36	
36	Save for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery; I for my
36	part scarce dared breathe, and sat with my eyes fixed on the faint
36	light of the kitchen door.  I could just see the curate's face, a dim,
36	oval shape, and his collar and cuffs.  Outside there began a metallic
36	hammering, then a violent hooting, and then again, after a quiet
36	interval, a hissing like the hissing of an engine.  These noises, for
36	the most part problematical, continued intermittently, and seemed if
36	anything to increase in number as time wore on.  Presently a measured
36	thudding and a vibration that made everything about us quiver and the
36	vessels in the pantry ring and shift, began and continued.  Once the
36	light was eclipsed, and the ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely
36	dark.  For many hours we must have crouched there, silent and
36	shivering, until our tired attention failed. . . .
36	
36	At last I found myself awake and very hungry.  I am inclined to
36	believe we must have spent the greater portion of a day before that
36	awakening.  My hunger was at a stride so insistent that it moved me to
36	action.  I told the curate I was going to seek food, and felt my way
36	towards the pantry.  He made me no answer, but so soon as I began
36	eating the faint noise I made stirred him up and I heard him crawling
36	after me.
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER TWO
36	
36	WHAT WE SAW FROM THE RUINED HOUSE
36	
36	
36	After eating we crept back to the scullery, and there I must have
36	dozed again, for when presently I looked round I was alone.  The
36	thudding vibration continued with wearisome persistence.  I whispered
36	for the curate several times, and at last felt my way to the door of
36	the kitchen.  It was still daylight, and I perceived him across the
36	room, lying against the triangular hole that looked out upon the
36	Martians.  His shoulders were hunched, so that his head was hidden
36	from me.
36	
36	I could hear a number of noises almost like those in an engine
36	shed; and the place rocked with that beating thud.  Through the
36	aperture in the wall I could see the top of a tree touched with gold
36	and the warm blue of a tranquil evening sky.  For a minute or so I
36	remained watching the curate, and then I advanced, crouching and
36	stepping with extreme care amid the broken crockery that littered the
36	floor.
36	
36	I touched the curate's leg, and he started so violently that a mass
36	of plaster went sliding down outside and fell with a loud impact.  I
36	gripped his arm, fearing he might cry out, and for a long time we
36	crouched motionless.  Then I turned to see how much of our rampart
36	remained.  The detachment of the plaster had left a vertical slit open
36	in the debris, and by raising myself cautiously across a beam I was
36	able to see out of this gap into what had been overnight a quiet
36	suburban roadway.  Vast, indeed, was the change that we beheld.
36	
36	The fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of the
36	house we had first visited.  The building had vanished, completely
36	smashed, pulverised, and dispersed by the blow.  The cylinder lay now
36	far beneath the original foundations--deep in a hole, already vastly
36	larger than the pit I had looked into at Woking.  The earth all round
36	it had splashed under that tremendous impact--""splashed"" is the only
36	word--and lay in heaped piles that hid the masses of the adjacent
36	houses.  It had behaved exactly like mud under the violent blow of a
36	hammer.  Our house had collapsed backward; the front portion, even on
36	the ground floor, had been destroyed completely; by a chance the
36	kitchen and scullery had escaped, and stood buried now under soil and
36	ruins, closed in by tons of earth on every side save towards the
36	cylinder.  Over that aspect we hung now on the very edge of the great
36	circular pit the Martians were engaged in making.  The heavy beating
36	sound was evidently just behind us, and ever and again a bright green
36	vapour drove up like a veil across our peephole.
36	
36	The cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit, and on
36	the farther edge of the pit, amid the smashed and gravel-heaped
36	shrubbery, one of the great fighting-machines, deserted by its
36	occupant, stood stiff and tall against the evening sky.  At first I
36	scarcely noticed the pit and the cylinder, although it has been
36	convenient to describe them first, on account of the extraordinary
36	glittering mechanism I saw busy in the excavation, and on account of
36	the strange creatures that were crawling slowly and painfully across
36	the heaped mould near it.
36	
36	The mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first.  It
36	was one of those complicated fabrics that have since been called
36	handling-machines, and the study of which has already given such an
36	enormous impetus to terrestrial invention.  As it dawned upon me
36	first, it presented a sort of metallic spider with five jointed,
36	agile legs, and with an extraordinary number of jointed levers, bars,
36	and reaching and clutching tentacles about its body.  Most of its
36	arms were retracted, but with three long tentacles it was fishing
36	out a number of rods, plates, and bars which lined the covering and
36	apparently strengthened the walls of the cylinder.  These, as it
36	extracted them, were lifted out and deposited upon a level surface
36	of earth behind it.
36	
36	Its motion was so swift, complex, and perfect that at first I did
36	not see it as a machine, in spite of its metallic glitter.  The
36	fighting-machines were coordinated and animated to an extraordinary
36	pitch, but nothing to compare with this.  People who have never seen
36	these structures, and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists or
36	the imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon,
36	scarcely realise that living quality.
36	
36	I recall particularly the illustration of one of the first
36	pamphlets to give a consecutive account of the war.  The artist had
36	evidently made a hasty study of one of the fighting-machines, and
36	there his knowledge ended.  He presented them as tilted, stiff
36	tripods, without either flexibility or subtlety, and with an
36	altogether misleading monotony of effect.  The pamphlet containing
36	these renderings had a considerable vogue, and I mention them here
36	simply to warn the reader against the impression they may have
36	created.  They were no more like the Martians I saw in action than a
36	Dutch doll is like a human being.  To my mind, the pamphlet would have
36	been much better without them.
36	
36	At first, I say, the handling-machine did not impress me as a
36	machine, but as a crablike creature with a glittering integument, the
36	controlling Martian whose delicate tentacles actuated its movements
36	seeming to be simply the equivalent of the crab's cerebral portion.
36	But then I perceived the resemblance of its grey-brown, shiny,
36	leathery integument to that of the other sprawling bodies beyond, and
36	the true nature of this dexterous workman dawned upon me.  With that
36	realisation my interest shifted to those other creatures, the real
36	Martians.  Already I had had a transient impression of these, and the
36	first nausea no longer obscured my observation.  Moreover, I was
36	concealed and motionless, and under no urgency of action.
36	
36	They were, I now saw, the most unearthly creatures it is possible
36	to conceive.  They were huge round bodies--or, rather, heads--about
36	four feet in diameter, each body having in front of it a face.  This
36	face had no nostrils--indeed, the Martians do not seem to have had any
36	sense of smell, but it had a pair of very large dark-coloured eyes,
36	and just beneath this a kind of fleshy beak.  In the back of this head
36	or body--I scarcely know how to speak of it--was the single tight
36	tympanic surface, since known to be anatomically an ear, though it
36	must have been almost useless in our dense air.  In a group round the
36	mouth were sixteen slender, almost whiplike tentacles, arranged in two
36	bunches of eight each.  These bunches have since been named rather
36	aptly, by that distinguished anatomist, Professor Howes, the _hands_.
36	Even as I saw these Martians for the first time they seemed to be
36	endeavouring to raise themselves on these hands, but of course, with
36	the increased weight of terrestrial conditions, this was impossible.
36	There is reason to suppose that on Mars they may have progressed upon
36	them with some facility.
36	
36	The internal anatomy, I may remark here, as dissection has since
36	shown, was almost equally simple.  The greater part of the structure
36	was the brain, sending enormous nerves to the eyes, ear, and tactile
36	tentacles.  Besides this were the bulky lungs, into which the mouth
36	opened, and the heart and its vessels.  The pulmonary distress caused
36	by the denser atmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was only
36	too evident in the convulsive movements of the outer skin.
36	
36	And this was the sum of the Martian organs.  Strange as it may seem
36	to a human being, all the complex apparatus of digestion, which makes
36	up the bulk of our bodies, did not exist in the Martians.  They were
36	heads--merely heads.  Entrails they had none.  They did not eat, much
36	less digest.  Instead, they took the fresh, living blood of other
36	creatures, and _injected_ it into their own veins.  I have myself seen
36	this being done, as I shall mention in its place.  But, squeamish as I
36	may seem, I cannot bring myself to describe what I could not endure
36	even to continue watching.  Let it suffice to say, blood obtained from
36	a still living animal, in most cases from a human being, was run
36	directly by means of a little pipette into the recipient canal. . . .
36	
36	The bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us, but at
36	the same time I think that we should remember how repulsive our
36	carnivorous habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit.
36	
36	The physiological advantages of the practice of injection are
36	undeniable, if one thinks of the tremendous waste of human time and
36	energy occasioned by eating and the digestive process.  Our bodies are
36	half made up of glands and tubes and organs, occupied in turning
36	heterogeneous food into blood.  The digestive processes and their
36	reaction upon the nervous system sap our strength and colour our
36	minds.  Men go happy or miserable as they have healthy or unhealthy
36	livers, or sound gastric glands.  But the Martians were lifted above
36	all these organic fluctuations of mood and emotion.
36	
36	Their undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishment
36	is partly explained by the nature of the remains of the victims they
36	had brought with them as provisions from Mars.  These creatures, to
36	judge from the shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands,
36	were bipeds with flimsy, silicious skeletons (almost like those of the
36	silicious sponges) and feeble musculature, standing about six feet
36	high and having round, erect heads, and large eyes in flinty sockets.
36	Two or three of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder, and
36	all were killed before earth was reached.  It was just as well for
36	them, for the mere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have
36	broken every bone in their bodies.
36	
36	And while I am engaged in this description, I may add in this place
36	certain further details which, although they were not all evident to
36	us at the time, will enable the reader who is unacquainted with them
36	to form a clearer picture of these offensive creatures.
36	
36	In three other points their physiology differed strangely from
36	ours.  Their organisms did not sleep, any more than the heart of man
36	sleeps.  Since they had no extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate,
36	that periodical extinction was unknown to them.  They had little or
36	no sense of fatigue, it would seem.  On earth they could never have
36	moved without effort, yet even to the last they kept in action.  In
36	twenty-four hours they did twenty-four hours of work, as even on earth
36	is perhaps the case with the ants.
36	
36	In the next place, wonderful as it seems in a sexual world, the
36	Martians were absolutely without sex, and therefore without any of the
36	tumultuous emotions that arise from that difference among men.  A
36	young Martian, there can now be no dispute, was really born upon earth
36	during the war, and it was found attached to its parent, partially
36	_budded_ off, just as young lilybulbs bud off, or like the young animals
36	in the fresh-water polyp.
36	
36	In man, in all the higher terrestrial animals, such a method of
36	increase has disappeared; but even on this earth it was certainly the
36	primitive method.  Among the lower animals, up even to those first
36	cousins of the vertebrated animals, the Tunicates, the two processes
36	occur side by side, but finally the sexual method superseded its
36	competitor altogether.  On Mars, however, just the reverse has
36	apparently been the case.
36	
36	It is worthy of remark that a certain speculative writer of
36	quasi-scientific repute, writing long before the Martian invasion, did
36	forecast for man a final structure not unlike the actual Martian
36	condition.  His prophecy, I remember, appeared in November or
36	December, 1893, in a long-defunct publication, the _Pall Mall Budget_,
36	and I recall a caricature of it in a pre-Martian periodical called
36	_Punch_.  He pointed out--writing in a foolish, facetious tone--that the
36	perfection of mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs;
36	the perfection of chemical devices, digestion; that such organs as
36	hair, external nose, teeth, ears, and chin were no longer essential
36	parts of the human being, and that the tendency of natural selection
36	would lie in the direction of their steady diminution through the
36	coming ages.  The brain alone remained a cardinal necessity.  Only one
36	other part of the body had a strong case for survival, and that was
36	the hand, ""teacher and agent of the brain.""  While the rest of the
36	body dwindled, the hands would grow larger.
36	
36	There is many a true word written in jest, and here in the Martians
36	we have beyond dispute the actual accomplishment of such a suppression
36	of the animal side of the organism by the intelligence.  To me it is
36	quite credible that the Martians may be descended from beings not
36	unlike ourselves, by a gradual development of brain and hands (the
36	latter giving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles at last)
36	at the expense of the rest of the body.  Without the body the brain
36	would, of course, become a mere selfish intelligence, without any of
36	the emotional substratum of the human being.
36	
36	The last salient point in which the systems of these creatures
36	differed from ours was in what one might have thought a very trivial
36	particular.  Micro-organisms, which cause so much disease and pain on
36	earth, have either never appeared upon Mars or Martian sanitary
36	science eliminated them ages ago.  A hundred diseases, all the fevers
36	and contagions of human life, consumption, cancers, tumours and such
36	morbidities, never enter the scheme of their life.  And speaking of
36	the differences between the life on Mars and terrestrial life, I may
36	allude here to the curious suggestions of the red weed.
36	
36	Apparently the vegetable kingdom in Mars, instead of having green
36	for a dominant colour, is of a vivid blood-red tint.  At any rate, the
36	seeds which the Martians (intentionally or accidentally) brought with
36	them gave rise in all cases to red-coloured growths.  Only that known
36	popularly as the red weed, however, gained any footing in competition
36	with terrestrial forms.  The red creeper was quite a transitory
36	growth, and few people have seen it growing.  For a time, however, the
36	red weed grew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance.  It spread up
36	the sides of the pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment,
36	and its cactus-like branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of
36	our triangular window.  And afterwards I found it broadcast throughout
36	the country, and especially wherever there was a stream of water.
36	
36	The Martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ, a
36	single round drum at the back of the head-body, and eyes with a visual
36	range not very different from ours except that, according to Philips,
36	blue and violet were as black to them.  It is commonly supposed that
36	they communicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations; this is
36	asserted, for instance, in the able but hastily compiled pamphlet
36	(written evidently by someone not an eye-witness of Martian actions)
36	to which I have already alluded, and which, so far, has been the chief
36	source of information concerning them.  Now no surviving human being
36	saw so much of the Martians in action as I did.  I take no credit to
36	myself for an accident, but the fact is so.  And I assert that I
36	watched them closely time after time, and that I have seen four, five,
36	and (once) six of them sluggishly performing the most elaborately
36	complicated operations together without either sound or gesture.  Their
36	peculiar hooting invariably preceded feeding; it had no modulation,
36	and was, I believe, in no sense a signal, but merely the expiration of
36	air preparatory to the suctional operation.  I have a certain claim to
36	at least an elementary knowledge of psychology, and in this matter I
36	am convinced--as firmly as I am convinced of anything--that the
36	Martians interchanged thoughts without any physical intermediation.
36	And I have been convinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions.
36	Before the Martian invasion, as an occasional reader here or there may
36	remember, I had written with some little vehemence against the
36	telepathic theory.
36	
36	The Martians wore no clothing.  Their conceptions of ornament and
36	decorum were necessarily different from ours; and not only were they
36	evidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are,
36	but changes of pressure do not seem to have affected their health at
36	all seriously.  Yet though they wore no clothing, it was in the other
36	artificial additions to their bodily resources that their great
36	superiority over man lay.  We men, with our bicycles and road-skates,
36	our Lilienthal soaring-machines, our guns and sticks and so forth, are
36	just in the beginning of the evolution that the Martians have worked
36	out.  They have become practically mere brains, wearing different
36	bodies according to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes and
36	take a bicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet.  And of their
36	appliances, perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the
36	curious fact that what is the dominant feature of almost all human
36	devices in mechanism is absent--the _wheel_ is absent; among all the
36	things they brought to earth there is no trace or suggestion of their
36	use of wheels.  One would have at least expected it in locomotion.  And
36	in this connection it is curious to remark that even on this earth
36	Nature has never hit upon the wheel, or has preferred other expedients
36	to its development.  And not only did the Martians either not know of
36	(which is incredible), or abstain from, the wheel, but in their
36	apparatus singularly little use is made of the fixed pivot or
36	relatively fixed pivot, with circular motions thereabout confined
36	to one plane.  Almost all the joints of the machinery present a
36	complicated system of sliding parts moving over small but beautifully
36	curved friction bearings.  And while upon this matter of detail, it is
36	remarkable that the long leverages of their machines are in most cases
36	actuated by a sort of sham musculature of the disks in an elastic
36	sheath; these disks become polarised and drawn closely and powerfully
36	together when traversed by a current of electricity.  In this way the
36	curious parallelism to animal motions, which was so striking and
36	disturbing to the human beholder, was attained.  Such quasi-muscles
36	abounded in the crablike handling-machine which, on my first peeping
36	out of the slit, I watched unpacking the cylinder.  It seemed
36	infinitely more alive than the actual Martians lying beyond it in the
36	sunset light, panting, stirring ineffectual tentacles, and moving
36	feebly after their vast journey across space.
36	
36	While I was still watching their sluggish motions in the sunlight,
36	and noting each strange detail of their form, the curate reminded me
36	of his presence by pulling violently at my arm.  I turned to a
36	scowling face, and silent, eloquent lips.  He wanted the slit, which
36	permitted only one of us to peep through; and so I had to forego
36	watching them for a time while he enjoyed that privilege.
36	
36	When I looked again, the busy handling-machine had already put
36	together several of the pieces of apparatus it had taken out of the
36	cylinder into a shape having an unmistakable likeness to its own; and
36	down on the left a busy little digging mechanism had come into view,
36	emitting jets of green vapour and working its way round the pit,
36	excavating and embanking in a methodical and discriminating manner.
36	This it was which had caused the regular beating noise, and the
36	rhythmic shocks that had kept our ruinous refuge quivering.  It piped
36	and whistled as it worked.  So far as I could see, the thing was
36	without a directing Martian at all.
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER THREE
36	
36	THE DAYS OF IMPRISONMENT
36	
36	
36	The arrival of a second fighting-machine drove us from our peephole
36	into the scullery, for we feared that from his elevation the Martian
36	might see down upon us behind our barrier.  At a later date we began
36	to feel less in danger of their eyes, for to an eye in the dazzle of
36	the sunlight outside our refuge must have been blank blackness, but at
36	first the slightest suggestion of approach drove us into the scullery
36	in heart-throbbing retreat.  Yet terrible as was the danger we
36	incurred, the attraction of peeping was for both of us irresistible.
36	And I recall now with a sort of wonder that, in spite of the infinite
36	danger in which we were between starvation and a still more terrible
36	death, we could yet struggle bitterly for that horrible privilege of
36	sight.  We would race across the kitchen in a grotesque way between
36	eagerness and the dread of making a noise, and strike each other, and
36	thrust and kick, within a few inches of exposure.
36	
36	The fact is that we had absolutely incompatible dispositions and
36	habits of thought and action, and our danger and isolation only
36	accentuated the incompatibility.  At Halliford I had already come to
36	hate the curate's trick of helpless exclamation, his stupid rigidity
36	of mind.  His endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort I made
36	to think out a line of action, and drove me at times, thus pent up and
36	intensified, almost to the verge of craziness.  He was as lacking in
36	restraint as a silly woman.  He would weep for hours together, and I
36	verily believe that to the very end this spoiled child of life thought
36	his weak tears in some way efficacious.  And I would sit in the
36	darkness unable to keep my mind off him by reason of his
36	importunities.  He ate more than I did, and it was in vain I pointed
36	out that our only chance of life was to stop in the house until the
36	Martians had done with their pit, that in that long patience a time
36	might presently come when we should need food.  He ate and drank
36	impulsively in heavy meals at long intervals.  He slept little.
36	
36	As the days wore on, his utter carelessness of any consideration so
36	intensified our distress and danger that I had, much as I loathed
36	doing it, to resort to threats, and at last to blows.  That brought him
36	to reason for a time.  But he was one of those weak creatures, void of
36	pride, timorous, anaemic, hateful souls, full of shifty cunning, who
36	face neither God nor man, who face not even themselves.
36	
36	It is disagreeable for me to recall and write these things, but I
36	set them down that my story may lack nothing.  Those who have escaped
36	the dark and terrible aspects of life will find my brutality, my flash
36	of rage in our final tragedy, easy enough to blame; for they know what
36	is wrong as well as any, but not what is possible to tortured men.  But
36	those who have been under the shadow, who have gone down at last to
36	elemental things, will have a wider charity.
36	
36	And while within we fought out our dark, dim contest of whispers,
36	snatched food and drink, and gripping hands and blows, without, in the
36	pitiless sunlight of that terrible June, was the strange wonder, the
36	unfamiliar routine of the Martians in the pit.  Let me return to those
36	first new experiences of mine.  After a long time I ventured back to
36	the peephole, to find that the new-comers had been reinforced by the
36	occupants of no fewer than three of the fighting-machines.  These last
36	had brought with them certain fresh appliances that stood in an
36	orderly manner about the cylinder.  The second handling-machine was now
36	completed, and was busied in serving one of the novel contrivances the
36	big machine had brought.  This was a body resembling a milk can in its
36	general form, above which oscillated a pear-shaped receptacle, and
36	from which a stream of white powder flowed into a circular basin
36	below.
36	
36	The oscillatory motion was imparted to this by one tentacle of the
36	handling-machine.  With two spatulate hands the handling-machine was
36	digging out and flinging masses of clay into the pear-shaped
36	receptacle above, while with another arm it periodically opened a door
36	and removed rusty and blackened clinkers from the middle part of the
36	machine.  Another steely tentacle directed the powder from the basin
36	along a ribbed channel towards some receiver that was hidden from me
36	by the mound of bluish dust.  From this unseen receiver a little
36	thread of green smoke rose vertically into the quiet air.  As I looked,
36	the handling-machine, with a faint and musical clinking, extended,
36	telescopic fashion, a tentacle that had been a moment before a mere
36	blunt projection, until its end was hidden behind the mound of clay.
36	In another second it had lifted a bar of white aluminium into sight,
36	untarnished as yet, and shining dazzlingly, and deposited it in a
36	growing stack of bars that stood at the side of the pit.  Between
36	sunset and starlight this dexterous machine must have made more than a
36	hundred such bars out of the crude clay, and the mound of bluish dust
36	rose steadily until it topped the side of the pit.
36	
36	The contrast between the swift and complex movements of these
36	contrivances and the inert panting clumsiness of their masters was
36	acute, and for days I had to tell myself repeatedly that these latter
36	were indeed the living of the two things.
36	
36	The curate had possession of the slit when the first men were
36	brought to the pit.  I was sitting below, huddled up, listening with
36	all my ears.  He made a sudden movement backward, and I, fearful that
36	we were observed, crouched in a spasm of terror.  He came sliding down
36	the rubbish and crept beside me in the darkness, inarticulate,
36	gesticulating, and for a moment I shared his panic.  His gesture
36	suggested a resignation of the slit, and after a little while my
36	curiosity gave me courage, and I rose up, stepped across him, and
36	clambered up to it.  At first I could see no reason for his frantic
36	behaviour.  The twilight had now come, the stars were little and
36	faint, but the pit was illuminated by the flickering green fire that
36	came from the aluminium-making.  The whole picture was a flickering
36	scheme of green gleams and shifting rusty black shadows, strangely
36	trying to the eyes.  Over and through it all went the bats, heeding it
36	not at all.  The sprawling Martians were no longer to be seen, the
36	mound of blue-green powder had risen to cover them from sight, and a
36	fighting-machine, with its legs contracted, crumpled, and abbreviated,
36	stood across the corner of the pit.  And then, amid the clangour of
36	the machinery, came a drifting suspicion of human voices, that I
36	entertained at first only to dismiss.
36	
36	I crouched, watching this fighting-machine closely, satisfying
36	myself now for the first time that the hood did indeed contain a
36	Martian.  As the green flames lifted I could see the oily gleam of
36	his integument and the brightness of his eyes.  And suddenly I heard
36	a yell, and saw a long tentacle reaching over the shoulder of the
36	machine to the little cage that hunched upon its back.  Then
36	something--something struggling violently--was lifted high against the
36	sky, a black, vague enigma against the starlight; and as this black
36	object came down again, I saw by the green brightness that it was a
36	man.  For an instant he was clearly visible.  He was a stout, ruddy,
36	middle-aged man, well dressed; three days before, he must have been
36	walking the world, a man of considerable consequence.  I could see his
36	staring eyes and gleams of light on his studs and watch chain.  He
36	vanished behind the mound, and for a moment there was silence.  And
36	then began a shrieking and a sustained and cheerful hooting from the
36	Martians.
36	
36	I slid down the rubbish, struggled to my feet, clapped my hands
36	over my ears, and bolted into the scullery.  The curate, who had been
36	crouching silently with his arms over his head, looked up as I passed,
36	cried out quite loudly at my desertion of him, and came running after
36	me.
36	
36	That night, as we lurked in the scullery, balanced between our
36	horror and the terrible fascination this peeping had, although I felt
36	an urgent need of action I tried in vain to conceive some plan of
36	escape; but afterwards, during the second day, I was able to consider
36	our position with great clearness.  The curate, I found, was quite
36	incapable of discussion; this new and culminating atrocity had robbed
36	him of all vestiges of reason or forethought.  Practically he had
36	already sunk to the level of an animal.  But as the saying goes, I
36	gripped myself with both hands.  It grew upon my mind, once I could
36	face the facts, that terrible as our position was, there was as yet
36	no justification for absolute despair.  Our chief chance lay in the
36	possibility of the Martians making the pit nothing more than a
36	temporary encampment.  Or even if they kept it permanently, they might
36	not consider it necessary to guard it, and a chance of escape might be
36	afforded us.  I also weighed very carefully the possibility of our
36	digging a way out in a direction away from the pit, but the chances of
36	our emerging within sight of some sentinel fighting-machine seemed at
36	first too great.  And I should have had to do all the digging myself.
36	The curate would certainly have failed me.
36	
36	It was on the third day, if my memory serves me right, that I saw
36	the lad killed.  It was the only occasion on which I actually saw the
36	Martians feed.  After that experience I avoided the hole in the wall
36	for the better part of a day.  I went into the scullery, removed the
36	door, and spent some hours digging with my hatchet as silently as
36	possible; but when I had made a hole about a couple of feet deep the
36	loose earth collapsed noisily, and I did not dare continue.  I lost
36	heart, and lay down on the scullery floor for a long time, having no
36	spirit even to move.  And after that I abandoned altogether the idea
36	of escaping by excavation.
36	
36	It says much for the impression the Martians had made upon me that
36	at first I entertained little or no hope of our escape being brought
36	about by their overthrow through any human effort.  But on the fourth
36	or fifth night I heard a sound like heavy guns.
36	
36	It was very late in the night, and the moon was shining brightly.
36	The Martians had taken away the excavating-machine, and, save for a
36	fighting-machine that stood in the remoter bank of the pit and a
36	handling-machine that was buried out of my sight in a corner of the
36	pit immediately beneath my peephole, the place was deserted by them.
36	Except for the pale glow from the handling-machine and the bars and
36	patches of white moonlight the pit was in darkness, and, except for
36	the clinking of the handling-machine, quite still.  That night was a
36	beautiful serenity; save for one planet, the moon seemed to have the
36	sky to herself.  I heard a dog howling, and that familiar sound it was
36	that made me listen.  Then I heard quite distinctly a booming exactly
36	like the sound of great guns.  Six distinct reports I counted, and
36	after a long interval six again.  And that was all.
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER FOUR
36	
36	THE DEATH OF THE CURATE
36	
36	
36	It was on the sixth day of our imprisonment that I peeped for the
36	last time, and presently found myself alone.  Instead of keeping close
36	to me and trying to oust me from the slit, the curate had gone back
36	into the scullery.  I was struck by a sudden thought.  I went back
36	quickly and quietly into the scullery.  In the darkness I heard the
36	curate drinking.  I snatched in the darkness, and my fingers caught a
36	bottle of burgundy.
36	
36	For a few minutes there was a tussle.  The bottle struck the floor
36	and broke, and I desisted and rose.  We stood panting and threatening
36	each other.  In the end I planted myself between him and the food, and
36	told him of my determination to begin a discipline.  I divided the
36	food in the pantry, into rations to last us ten days.  I would not let
36	him eat any more that day.  In the afternoon he made a feeble effort
36	to get at the food.  I had been dozing, but in an instant I was awake.
36	All day and all night we sat face to face, I weary but resolute, and
36	he weeping and complaining of his immediate hunger.  It was, I know, a
36	night and a day, but to me it seemed--it seems now--an interminable
36	length of time.
36	
36	And so our widened incompatibility ended at last in open conflict.
36	For two vast days we struggled in undertones and wrestling contests.
36	There were times when I beat and kicked him madly, times when I
36	cajoled and persuaded him, and once I tried to bribe him with the last
36	bottle of burgundy, for there was a rain-water pump from which I could
36	get water.  But neither force nor kindness availed; he was indeed
36	beyond reason.  He would neither desist from his attacks on the food
36	nor from his noisy babbling to himself.  The rudimentary precautions
36	to keep our imprisonment endurable he would not observe.  Slowly I
36	began to realise the complete overthrow of his intelligence, to
36	perceive that my sole companion in this close and sickly darkness was
36	a man insane.
36	
36	From certain vague memories I am inclined to think my own mind
36	wandered at times.  I had strange and hideous dreams whenever I slept.
36	It sounds paradoxical, but I am inclined to think that the weakness
36	and insanity of the curate warned me, braced me, and kept me a sane
36	man.
36	
36	On the eighth day he began to talk aloud instead of whispering, and
36	nothing I could do would moderate his speech.
36	
36	""It is just, O God!"" he would say, over and over again. ""It is
36	just.  On me and mine be the punishment laid.  We have sinned, we have
36	fallen short.  There was poverty, sorrow; the poor were trodden in
36	the dust, and I held my peace.  I preached acceptable folly--my God,
36	what folly!--when I should have stood up, though I died for it, and
36	called upon them to repent--repent! . . .  Oppressors of the poor and
36	needy . . . !  The wine press of God!""
36	
36	Then he would suddenly revert to the matter of the food I withheld
36	from him, praying, begging, weeping, at last threatening.  He began to
36	raise his voice--I prayed him not to.  He perceived a hold on me--he
36	threatened he would shout and bring the Martians upon us.  For a time
36	that scared me; but any concession would have shortened our chance of
36	escape beyond estimating.  I defied him, although I felt no assurance
36	that he might not do this thing.  But that day, at any rate, he did
36	not.  He talked with his voice rising slowly, through the greater part
36	of the eighth and ninth days--threats, entreaties, mingled with a
36	torrent of half-sane and always frothy repentance for his vacant sham
36	of God's service, such as made me pity him.  Then he slept awhile, and
36	began again with renewed strength, so loudly that I must needs make
36	him desist.
36	
36	""Be still!"" I implored.
36	
36	He rose to his knees, for he had been sitting in the darkness near
36	the copper.
36	
36	""I have been still too long,"" he said, in a tone that must have
36	reached the pit, ""and now I must bear my witness.  Woe unto this
36	unfaithful city!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe! To the inhabitants of
36	the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet----""
36	
36	""Shut up!"" I said, rising to my feet, and in a terror lest the
36	Martians should hear us.  ""For God's sake----""
36	
36	""Nay,"" shouted the curate, at the top of his voice, standing
36	likewise and extending his arms.  ""Speak!  The word of the Lord is
36	upon me!""
36	
36	In three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen.
36	
36	""I must bear my witness!  I go!  It has already been too long
36	delayed.""
36	
36	I put out my hand and felt the meat chopper hanging to the wall.
36	In a flash I was after him.  I was fierce with fear.  Before he was
36	halfway across the kitchen I had overtaken him.  With one last touch
36	of humanity I turned the blade back and struck him with the butt.  He
36	went headlong forward and lay stretched on the ground.  I stumbled
36	over him and stood panting.  He lay still.
36	
36	Suddenly I heard a noise without, the run and smash of slipping
36	plaster, and the triangular aperture in the wall was darkened.  I
36	looked up and saw the lower surface of a handling-machine coming
36	slowly across the hole.  One of its gripping limbs curled amid the
36	debris; another limb appeared, feeling its way over the fallen beams.
36	I stood petrified, staring.  Then I saw through a sort of glass plate
36	near the edge of the body the face, as we may call it, and the large
36	dark eyes of a Martian, peering, and then a long metallic snake of
36	tentacle came feeling slowly through the hole.
36	
36	I turned by an effort, stumbled over the curate, and stopped at the
36	scullery door.  The tentacle was now some way, two yards or more, in
36	the room, and twisting and turning, with queer sudden movements, this
36	way and that.  For a while I stood fascinated by that slow, fitful
36	advance.  Then, with a faint, hoarse cry, I forced myself across the
36	scullery.  I trembled violently; I could scarcely stand upright.  I
36	opened the door of the coal cellar, and stood there in the darkness
36	staring at the faintly lit doorway into the kitchen, and listening.
36	Had the Martian seen me?  What was it doing now?
36	
36	Something was moving to and fro there, very quietly; every now and
36	then it tapped against the wall, or started on its movements with a
36	faint metallic ringing, like the movements of keys on a split-ring.
36	Then a heavy body--I knew too well what--was dragged across the floor
36	of the kitchen towards the opening.  Irresistibly attracted, I crept
36	to the door and peeped into the kitchen.  In the triangle of bright
36	outer sunlight I saw the Martian, in its Briareus of a handling-machine,
36	scrutinizing the curate's head.  I thought at once that it would infer
36	my presence from the mark of the blow I had given him.
36	
36	I crept back to the coal cellar, shut the door, and began to cover
36	myself up as much as I could, and as noiselessly as possible in the
36	darkness, among the firewood and coal therein.  Every now and then I
36	paused, rigid, to hear if the Martian had thrust its tentacles through
36	the opening again.
36	
36	Then the faint metallic jingle returned.  I traced it slowly
36	feeling over the kitchen.  Presently I heard it nearer--in the
36	scullery, as I judged.  I thought that its length might be
36	insufficient to reach me.  I prayed copiously.  It passed, scraping
36	faintly across the cellar door.  An age of almost intolerable suspense
36	intervened; then I heard it fumbling at the latch! It had found the
36	door!  The Martians understood doors!
36	
36	It worried at the catch for a minute, perhaps, and then the door
36	opened.
36	
36	In the darkness I could just see the thing--like an elephant's
36	trunk more than anything else--waving towards me and touching and
36	examining the wall, coals, wood and ceiling.  It was like a black worm
36	swaying its blind head to and fro.
36	
36	Once, even, it touched the heel of my boot.  I was on the verge of
36	screaming; I bit my hand.  For a time the tentacle was silent.  I
36	could have fancied it had been withdrawn.  Presently, with an abrupt
36	click, it gripped something--I thought it had me!--and seemed to go
36	out of the cellar again.  For a minute I was not sure.  Apparently it
36	had taken a lump of coal to examine.
36	
36	I seized the opportunity of slightly shifting my position, which
36	had become cramped, and then listened.  I whispered passionate prayers
36	for safety.
36	
36	Then I heard the slow, deliberate sound creeping towards me again.
36	Slowly, slowly it drew near, scratching against the walls and tapping
36	the furniture.
36	
36	While I was still doubtful, it rapped smartly against the cellar
36	door and closed it.  I heard it go into the pantry, and the biscuit-tins
36	rattled and a bottle smashed, and then came a heavy bump against
36	the cellar door.  Then silence that passed into an infinity of
36	suspense.
36	
36	Had it gone?
36	
36	At last I decided that it had.
36	
36	It came into the scullery no more; but I lay all the tenth day in
36	the close darkness, buried among coals and firewood, not daring even
36	to crawl out for the drink for which I craved.  It was the eleventh day
36	before I ventured so far from my security.
36	
36

36	CHAPTER FIVE
36	
36	THE STILLNESS
36	
36	
36	My first act before I went into the pantry was to fasten the door
36	between the kitchen and the scullery.  But the pantry was empty; every
36	scrap of food had gone.  Apparently, the Martian had taken it all on
36	the previous day.  At that discovery I despaired for the first time.  I
36	took no food, or no drink either, on the eleventh or the twelfth day.
36	
36	At first my mouth and throat were parched, and my strength ebbed
36	sensibly.  I sat about in the darkness of the scullery, in a state of
36	despondent wretchedness.  My mind ran on eating.  I thought I had
36	become deaf, for the noises of movement I had been accustomed to hear
36	from the pit had ceased absolutely.  I did not feel strong enough to
36	crawl noiselessly to the peephole, or I would have gone there.
36	
36	On the twelfth day my throat was so painful that, taking the chance
36	of alarming the Martians, I attacked the creaking rain-water pump that
36	stood by the sink, and got a couple of glassfuls of blackened and
36	tainted rain water.  I was greatly refreshed by this, and emboldened
36	by the fact that no enquiring tentacle followed the noise of my
36	pumping.
36	
36	During these days, in a rambling, inconclusive way, I thought much
36	of the curate and of the manner of his death.
36	
36	On the thirteenth day I drank some more water, and dozed and
36	thought disjointedly of eating and of vague impossible plans of
36	escape.  Whenever I dozed I dreamt of horrible phantasms, of the death
36	of the curate, or of sumptuous dinners; but, asleep or awake, I felt a
36	keen pain that urged me to drink again and again.  The light that came
36	into the scullery was no longer grey, but red.  To my disordered
36	imagination it seemed the colour of blood.
36	
36	On the fourteenth day I went into the kitchen, and I was surprised
36	to find that the fronds of the red weed had grown right across
36	the hole in the wall, turning the half-light of the place into a
36	crimson-coloured obscurity.
36	
36	It was early on the fifteenth day that I heard a curious, familiar
36	sequence of sounds in the kitchen, and, listening, identified it as
36	the snuffing and scratching of a dog.  Going into the kitchen, I saw a
36	dog's nose peering in through a break among the ruddy fronds.  This
36	greatly surprised me.  At the scent of me he barked shortly.
36	
36	I thought if I could induce him to come into the place quietly I
36	should be able, perhaps, to kill and eat him; and in any case, it
36	would be advisable to kill him, lest his actions attracted the
36	attention of the Martians.
36	
36	I crept forward, saying ""Good dog!"" very softly; but he suddenly
36	withdrew his head and disappeared.
36	
36	I listened--I was not deaf--but certainly the pit was still.  I
36	heard a sound like the flutter of a bird's wings, and a hoarse
36	croaking, but that was all.
36	
36	For a long while I lay close to the peephole, but not daring to
36	move aside the red plants that obscured it.  Once or twice I heard a
36	faint pitter-patter like the feet of the dog going hither and thither
36	on the sand far below me, and there were more birdlike sounds, but
36	that was all.  At length, encouraged by the silence, I looked out.
36	
36	Except in the corner, where a multitude of crows hopped and fought
36	over the skeletons of the dead the Martians had consumed, there was
36	not a living thing in the pit.
36	
36	I stared about me, scarcely believing my eyes.  All the machinery
36	had gone.  Save for the big mound of greyish-blue powder in one
36	corner, certain bars of aluminium in another, the black birds, and the
36	skeletons of the killed, the place was merely an empty circular pit in
36	the sand.
36	
36	Slowly I thrust myself out through the red weed, and stood upon the
36	mound of rubble.  I could see in any direction save behind me, to the
36	north, and neither Martians nor sign of Martians were to be seen.  The
36	pit dropped sheerly from my feet, but a little way along the rubbish
36	afforded a practicable slope to the summit of the ruins.  My chance of
36	escape had come.  I began to tremble.
36	
36	I hesitated for some time, and then, in a gust of desperate
36	resolution, and with a heart that throbbed violently, I scrambled to
36	the top of the mound in which I had been buried so long.
36	
36	I looked about again.  To the northward, too, no Martian was
36	visible.
36	
36	When I had last seen this part of Sheen in the daylight it had been
36	a straggling street of comfortable white and red houses, interspersed
36	with abundant shady trees.  Now I stood on a mound of smashed
36	brickwork, clay, and gravel, over which spread a multitude of red
36	cactus-shaped plants, knee-high, without a solitary terrestrial growth
36	to dispute their footing.  The trees near me were dead and brown, but
36	further a network of red thread scaled the still living stems.
36	
36	The neighbouring houses had all been wrecked, but none had been
36	burned; their walls stood, sometimes to the second story, with smashed
36	windows and shattered doors.  The red weed grew tumultuously in their
36	roofless rooms.  Below me was the great pit, with the crows struggling
36	for its refuse.  A number of other birds hopped about among the ruins.
36	Far away I saw a gaunt cat slink crouchingly along a wall, but traces
36	of men there were none.
36	
36	The day seemed, by contrast with my recent confinement, dazzlingly
36	bright, the sky a glowing blue.  A gentle breeze kept the red weed
36	that covered every scrap of unoccupied ground gently swaying.  And oh!
36	the sweetness of the air!
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER SIX
36	
36	THE WORK OF FIFTEEN DAYS
36	
36	
36	For some time I stood tottering on the mound regardless of my
36	safety.  Within that noisome den from which I had emerged I had
36	thought with a narrow intensity only of our immediate security.  I had
36	not realised what had been happening to the world, had not anticipated
36	this startling vision of unfamiliar things.  I had expected to see
36	Sheen in ruins--I found about me the landscape, weird and lurid, of
36	another planet.
36	
36	For that moment I touched an emotion beyond the common range of
36	men, yet one that the poor brutes we dominate know only too well.  I
36	felt as a rabbit might feel returning to his burrow and suddenly
36	confronted by the work of a dozen busy navvies digging the foundations
36	of a house.  I felt the first inkling of a thing that presently grew
36	quite clear in my mind, that oppressed me for many days, a sense of
36	dethronement, a persuasion that I was no longer a master, but an
36	animal among the animals, under the Martian heel.  With us it would be
36	as with them, to lurk and watch, to run and hide; the fear and empire
36	of man had passed away.
36	
36	But so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed, and my
36	dominant motive became the hunger of my long and dismal fast.  In the
36	direction away from the pit I saw, beyond a red-covered wall, a patch
36	of garden ground unburied.  This gave me a hint, and I went knee-deep,
36	and sometimes neck-deep, in the red weed.  The density of the
36	weed gave me a reassuring sense of hiding.  The wall was some six feet
36	high, and when I attempted to clamber it I found I could not lift my
36	feet to the crest.  So I went along by the side of it, and came to a
36	corner and a rockwork that enabled me to get to the top, and tumble
36	into the garden I coveted.  Here I found some young onions, a couple
36	of gladiolus bulbs, and a quantity of immature carrots, all of which I
36	secured, and, scrambling over a ruined wall, went on my way through
36	scarlet and crimson trees towards Kew--it was like walking through an
36	avenue of gigantic blood drops--possessed with two ideas: to get more
36	food, and to limp, as soon and as far as my strength permitted, out of
36	this accursed unearthly region of the pit.
36	
36	Some way farther, in a grassy place, was a group of mushrooms which
36	also I devoured, and then I came upon a brown sheet of flowing shallow
36	water, where meadows used to be.  These fragments of nourishment served
36	only to whet my hunger.  At first I was surprised at this flood in a
36	hot, dry summer, but afterwards I discovered that it was caused by the
36	tropical exuberance of the red weed.  Directly this extraordinary
36	growth encountered water it straightway became gigantic and of
36	unparalleled fecundity.  Its seeds were simply poured down into the
36	water of the Wey and Thames, and its swiftly growing and Titanic water
36	fronds speedily choked both those rivers.
36	
36	At Putney, as I afterwards saw, the bridge was almost lost in a
36	tangle of this weed, and at Richmond, too, the Thames water poured in
36	a broad and shallow stream across the meadows of Hampton and
36	Twickenham.  As the water spread the weed followed them, until the
36	ruined villas of the Thames valley were for a time lost in this red
36	swamp, whose margin I explored, and much of the desolation the
36	Martians had caused was concealed.
36	
36	In the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as it had
36	spread.  A cankering disease, due, it is believed, to the action of
36	certain bacteria, presently seized upon it.  Now by the action of
36	natural selection, all terrestrial plants have acquired a resisting
36	power against bacterial diseases--they never succumb without a severe
36	struggle, but the red weed rotted like a thing already dead.  The
36	fronds became bleached, and then shrivelled and brittle.  They broke
36	off at the least touch, and the waters that had stimulated their early
36	growth carried their last vestiges out to sea.
36	
36	My first act on coming to this water was, of course, to slake my
36	thirst.  I drank a great deal of it and, moved by an impulse, gnawed
36	some fronds of red weed; but they were watery, and had a sickly,
36	metallic taste.  I found the water was sufficiently shallow for me to
36	wade securely, although the red weed impeded my feet a little; but the
36	flood evidently got deeper towards the river, and I turned back to
36	Mortlake.  I managed to make out the road by means of occasional ruins
36	of its villas and fences and lamps, and so presently I got out of this
36	spate and made my way to the hill going up towards Roehampton and came
36	out on Putney Common.
36	
36	Here the scenery changed from the strange and unfamiliar to the
36	wreckage of the familiar: patches of ground exhibited the devastation
36	of a cyclone, and in a few score yards I would come upon perfectly
36	undisturbed spaces, houses with their blinds trimly drawn and doors
36	closed, as if they had been left for a day by the owners, or as if
36	their inhabitants slept within.  The red weed was less abundant; the
36	tall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper.  I hunted
36	for food among the trees, finding nothing, and I also raided a couple
36	of silent houses, but they had already been broken into and ransacked.
36	I rested for the remainder of the daylight in a shrubbery, being, in
36	my enfeebled condition, too fatigued to push on.
36	
36	All this time I saw no human beings, and no signs of the Martians.
36	I encountered a couple of hungry-looking dogs, but both hurried
36	circuitously away from the advances I made them.  Near Roehampton I
36	had seen two human skeletons--not bodies, but skeletons, picked
36	clean--and in the wood by me I found the crushed and scattered bones
36	of several cats and rabbits and the skull of a sheep.  But though I
36	gnawed parts of these in my mouth, there was nothing to be got from
36	them.
36	
36	After sunset I struggled on along the road towards Putney, where I
36	think the Heat-Ray must have been used for some reason.  And in the
36	garden beyond Roehampton I got a quantity of immature potatoes,
36	sufficient to stay my hunger.  From this garden one looked down upon
36	Putney and the river.  The aspect of the place in the dusk was
36	singularly desolate: blackened trees, blackened, desolate ruins, and
36	down the hill the sheets of the flooded river, red-tinged with the
36	weed.  And over all--silence.  It filled me with indescribable terror
36	to think how swiftly that desolating change had come.
36	
36	For a time I believed that mankind had been swept out of existence,
36	and that I stood there alone, the last man left alive.  Hard by the
36	top of Putney Hill I came upon another skeleton, with the arms
36	dislocated and removed several yards from the rest of the body.  As I
36	proceeded I became more and more convinced that the extermination of
36	mankind was, save for such stragglers as myself, already accomplished
36	in this part of the world.  The Martians, I thought, had gone on and
36	left the country desolated, seeking food elsewhere.  Perhaps even now
36	they were destroying Berlin or Paris, or it might be they had gone
36	northward.
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER SEVEN
36	
36	THE MAN ON PUTNEY HILL
36	
36	
36	I spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of Putney
36	Hill, sleeping in a made bed for the first time since my flight to
36	Leatherhead.  I will not tell the needless trouble I had breaking into
36	that house--afterwards I found the front door was on the latch--nor
36	how I ransacked every room for food, until just on the verge of
36	despair, in what seemed to me to be a servant's bedroom, I found a
36	rat-gnawed crust and two tins of pineapple.  The place had been
36	already searched and emptied.  In the bar I afterwards found some
36	biscuits and sandwiches that had been overlooked.  The latter I could
36	not eat, they were too rotten, but the former not only stayed my
36	hunger, but filled my pockets.  I lit no lamps, fearing some Martian
36	might come beating that part of London for food in the night.  Before
36	I went to bed I had an interval of restlessness, and prowled from
36	window to window, peering out for some sign of these monsters.  I
36	slept little.  As I lay in bed I found myself thinking consecutively--a
36	thing I do not remember to have done since my last argument with the
36	curate.  During all the intervening time my mental condition had been
36	a hurrying succession of vague emotional states or a sort of stupid
36	receptivity.  But in the night my brain, reinforced, I suppose, by the
36	food I had eaten, grew clear again, and I thought.
36	
36	Three things struggled for possession of my mind: the killing of
36	the curate, the whereabouts of the Martians, and the possible fate of
36	my wife.  The former gave me no sensation of horror or remorse to
36	recall; I saw it simply as a thing done, a memory infinitely
36	disagreeable but quite without the quality of remorse.  I saw myself
36	then as I see myself now, driven step by step towards that hasty blow,
36	the creature of a sequence of accidents leading inevitably to that.  I
36	felt no condemnation; yet the memory, static, unprogressive, haunted
36	me.  In the silence of the night, with that sense of the nearness of
36	God that sometimes comes into the stillness and the darkness, I stood
36	my trial, my only trial, for that moment of wrath and fear.  I
36	retraced every step of our conversation from the moment when I had
36	found him crouching beside me, heedless of my thirst, and pointing to
36	the fire and smoke that streamed up from the ruins of Weybridge.  We
36	had been incapable of co-operation--grim chance had taken no heed of
36	that.  Had I foreseen, I should have left him at Halliford.  But I did
36	not foresee; and crime is to foresee and do.  And I set this down as I
36	have set all this story down, as it was.  There were no witnesses--all
36	these things I might have concealed.  But I set it down, and the
36	reader must form his judgment as he will.
36	
36	And when, by an effort, I had set aside that picture of a prostrate
36	body, I faced the problem of the Martians and the fate of my wife.  For
36	the former I had no data; I could imagine a hundred things, and so,
36	unhappily, I could for the latter.  And suddenly that night became
36	terrible.  I found myself sitting up in bed, staring at the dark.  I
36	found myself praying that the Heat-Ray might have suddenly and
36	painlessly struck her out of being.  Since the night of my return from
36	Leatherhead I had not prayed.  I had uttered prayers, fetish prayers,
36	had prayed as heathens mutter charms when I was in extremity; but now
36	I prayed indeed, pleading steadfastly and sanely, face to face with
36	the darkness of God.  Strange night!  Strangest in this, that so soon
36	as dawn had come, I, who had talked with God, crept out of the house
36	like a rat leaving its hiding place--a creature scarcely larger, an
36	inferior animal, a thing that for any passing whim of our masters
36	might be hunted and killed.  Perhaps they also prayed confidently to
36	God.  Surely, if we have learned nothing else, this war has taught us
36	pity--pity for those witless souls that suffer our dominion.
36	
36	The morning was bright and fine, and the eastern sky glowed pink,
36	and was fretted with little golden clouds.  In the road that runs from
36	the top of Putney Hill to Wimbledon was a number of poor vestiges of
36	the panic torrent that must have poured Londonward on the Sunday night
36	after the fighting began.  There was a little two-wheeled cart
36	inscribed with the name of Thomas Lobb, Greengrocer, New Malden, with
36	a smashed wheel and an abandoned tin trunk; there was a straw hat
36	trampled into the now hardened mud, and at the top of West Hill a lot
36	of blood-stained glass about the overturned water trough.  My
36	movements were languid, my plans of the vaguest.  I had an idea of
36	going to Leatherhead, though I knew that there I had the poorest
36	chance of finding my wife.  Certainly, unless death had overtaken them
36	suddenly, my cousins and she would have fled thence; but it seemed to
36	me I might find or learn there whither the Surrey people had fled.  I
36	knew I wanted to find my wife, that my heart ached for her and the
36	world of men, but I had no clear idea how the finding might be done.  I
36	was also sharply aware now of my intense loneliness.  From the corner
36	I went, under cover of a thicket of trees and bushes, to the edge of
36	Wimbledon Common, stretching wide and far.
36	
36	That dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse and broom;
36	there was no red weed to be seen, and as I prowled, hesitating, on the
36	verge of the open, the sun rose, flooding it all with light and
36	vitality.  I came upon a busy swarm of little frogs in a swampy place
36	among the trees.  I stopped to look at them, drawing a lesson from
36	their stout resolve to live.  And presently, turning suddenly, with an
36	odd feeling of being watched, I beheld something crouching amid a
36	clump of bushes.  I stood regarding this.  I made a step towards it,
36	and it rose up and became a man armed with a cutlass.  I approached
36	him slowly.  He stood silent and motionless, regarding me.
36	
36	As I drew nearer I perceived he was dressed in clothes as dusty and
36	filthy as my own; he looked, indeed, as though he had been dragged
36	through a culvert.  Nearer, I distinguished the green slime of ditches
36	mixing with the pale drab of dried clay and shiny, coaly patches.  His
36	black hair fell over his eyes, and his face was dark and dirty and
36	sunken, so that at first I did not recognise him.  There was a red cut
36	across the lower part of his face.
36	
36	""Stop!"" he cried, when I was within ten yards of him, and I
36	stopped.  His voice was hoarse.  ""Where do you come from?"" he said.
36	
36	I thought, surveying him.
36	
36	""I come from Mortlake,"" I said.  ""I was buried near the pit the
36	Martians made about their cylinder.  I have worked my way out and
36	escaped.""
36	
36	""There is no food about here,"" he said.  ""This is my country.  All
36	this hill down to the river, and back to Clapham, and up to the edge
36	of the common.  There is only food for one.  Which way are you going?""
36	
36	I answered slowly.
36	
36	""I don't know,"" I said.  ""I have been buried in the ruins of a
36	house thirteen or fourteen days.  I don't know what has happened.""
36	
36	He looked at me doubtfully, then started, and looked with a changed
36	expression.
36	
36	""I've no wish to stop about here,"" said I.  ""I think I shall go to
36	Leatherhead, for my wife was there.""
36	
36	He shot out a pointing finger.
36	
36	""It is you,"" said he; ""the man from Woking.  And you weren't killed
36	at Weybridge?""
36	
36	I recognised him at the same moment.
36	
36	""You are the artilleryman who came into my garden.""
36	
36	""Good luck!"" he said.  ""We are lucky ones!  Fancy _you_!""  He put out
36	a hand, and I took it.  ""I crawled up a drain,"" he said. ""But they
36	didn't kill everyone.  And after they went away I got off towards
36	Walton across the fields.  But---- It's not sixteen days altogether--and
36	your hair is grey.""  He looked over his shoulder suddenly.  ""Only
36	a rook,"" he said.  ""One gets to know that birds have shadows these
36	days.  This is a bit open.  Let us crawl under those bushes and talk.""
36	
36	""Have you seen any Martians?"" I said.  ""Since I crawled out----""
36	
36	""They've gone away across London,"" he said.  ""I guess they've got a
36	bigger camp there.  Of a night, all over there, Hampstead way, the sky
36	is alive with their lights.  It's like a great city, and in the glare
36	you can just see them moving.  By daylight you can't.  But nearer--I
36	haven't seen them--"" (he counted on his fingers) ""five days.  Then I
36	saw a couple across Hammersmith way carrying something big.  And the
36	night before last""--he stopped and spoke impressively--""it was just a
36	matter of lights, but it was something up in the air.  I believe
36	they've built a flying-machine, and are learning to fly.""
36	
36	I stopped, on hands and knees, for we had come to the bushes.
36	
36	""Fly!""
36	
36	""Yes,"" he said, ""fly.""
36	
36	I went on into a little bower, and sat down.
36	
36	""It is all over with humanity,"" I said.  ""If they can do that they
36	will simply go round the world.""
36	
36	He nodded.
36	
36	""They will.  But---- It will relieve things over here a bit.  And
36	besides----""  He looked at me.  ""Aren't you satisfied it _is_ up with
36	humanity?  I am.  We're down; we're beat.""
36	
36	I stared.  Strange as it may seem, I had not arrived at this fact--a
36	fact perfectly obvious so soon as he spoke.  I had still held a
36	vague hope; rather, I had kept a lifelong habit of mind.  He repeated
36	his words, ""We're beat.""  They carried absolute conviction.
36	
36	""It's all over,"" he said.  ""They've lost _one_--just _one_.  And they've
36	made their footing good and crippled the greatest power in the world.
36	They've walked over us.  The death of that one at Weybridge was an
36	accident.  And these are only pioneers.  They kept on coming.  These
36	green stars--I've seen none these five or six days, but I've no doubt
36	they're falling somewhere every night.  Nothing's to be done.  We're
36	under! We're beat!""
36	
36	I made him no answer.  I sat staring before me, trying in vain to
36	devise some countervailing thought.
36	
36	""This isn't a war,"" said the artilleryman.  ""It never was a war,
36	any more than there's war between man and ants.""
36	
36	Suddenly I recalled the night in the observatory.
36	
36	""After the tenth shot they fired no more--at least, until the first
36	cylinder came.""
36	
36	""How do you know?"" said the artilleryman.  I explained.  He thought.
36	""Something wrong with the gun,"" he said.  ""But what if there is?
36	They'll get it right again.  And even if there's a delay, how can it
36	alter the end?  It's just men and ants.  There's the ants builds their
36	cities, live their lives, have wars, revolutions, until the men want
36	them out of the way, and then they go out of the way.  That's what we
36	are now--just ants.  Only----""
36	
36	""Yes,"" I said.
36	
36	""We're eatable ants.""
36	
36	We sat looking at each other.
36	
36	""And what will they do with us?"" I said.
36	
36	""That's what I've been thinking,"" he said; ""that's what I've been
36	thinking.  After Weybridge I went south--thinking.  I saw what was up.
36	Most of the people were hard at it squealing and exciting themselves.
36	But I'm not so fond of squealing.  I've been in sight of death once or
36	twice; I'm not an ornamental soldier, and at the best and worst,
36	death--it's just death.  And it's the man that keeps on thinking comes
36	through.  I saw everyone tracking away south.  Says I, 'Food won't
36	last this way,' and I turned right back.  I went for the Martians like
36	a sparrow goes for man.  All round""--he waved a hand to the
36	horizon--""they're starving in heaps, bolting, treading on each other.
36	. . .""
36	
36	He saw my face, and halted awkwardly.
36	
36	""No doubt lots who had money have gone away to France,"" he said.  He
36	seemed to hesitate whether to apologise, met my eyes, and went on:
36	""There's food all about here.  Canned things in shops; wines, spirits,
36	mineral waters; and the water mains and drains are empty.  Well, I was
36	telling you what I was thinking.  'Here's intelligent things,' I said,
36	'and it seems they want us for food.  First, they'll smash us up--ships,
36	machines, guns, cities, all the order and organisation.  All
36	that will go.  If we were the size of ants we might pull through.  But
36	we're not.  It's all too bulky to stop.  That's the first certainty.'
36	Eh?""
36	
36	I assented.
36	
36	""It is; I've thought it out.  Very well, then--next; at present
36	we're caught as we're wanted.  A Martian has only to go a few miles to
36	get a crowd on the run.  And I saw one, one day, out by Wandsworth,
36	picking houses to pieces and routing among the wreckage.  But they
36	won't keep on doing that.  So soon as they've settled all our guns and
36	ships, and smashed our railways, and done all the things they are
36	doing over there, they will begin catching us systematic, picking the
36	best and storing us in cages and things.  That's what they will start
36	doing in a bit.  Lord!  They haven't begun on us yet.  Don't you see
36	that?""
36	
36	""Not begun!"" I exclaimed.
36	
36	""Not begun.  All that's happened so far is through our not having
36	the sense to keep quiet--worrying them with guns and such foolery.  And
36	losing our heads, and rushing off in crowds to where there wasn't any
36	more safety than where we were.  They don't want to bother us yet.
36	They're making their things--making all the things they couldn't bring
36	with them, getting things ready for the rest of their people.  Very
36	likely that's why the cylinders have stopped for a bit, for fear of
36	hitting those who are here.  And instead of our rushing about blind,
36	on the howl, or getting dynamite on the chance of busting them up,
36	we've got to fix ourselves up according to the new state of affairs.
36	That's how I figure it out.  It isn't quite according to what a man
36	wants for his species, but it's about what the facts point to.  And
36	that's the principle I acted upon.  Cities, nations, civilisation,
36	progress--it's all over.  That game's up.  We're beat.""
36	
36	""But if that is so, what is there to live for?""
36	
36	The artilleryman looked at me for a moment.
36	
36	""There won't be any more blessed concerts for a million years or
36	so; there won't be any Royal Academy of Arts, and no nice little feeds
36	at restaurants.  If it's amusement you're after, I reckon the game is
36	up.  If you've got any drawing-room manners or a dislike to eating
36	peas with a knife or dropping aitches, you'd better chuck 'em away.
36	They ain't no further use.""
36	
36	""You mean----""
36	
36	""I mean that men like me are going on living--for the sake of the
36	breed.  I tell you, I'm grim set on living.  And if I'm not mistaken,
36	you'll show what insides _you've_ got, too, before long.  We aren't
36	going to be exterminated.  And I don't mean to be caught either, and
36	tamed and fattened and bred like a thundering ox.  Ugh! Fancy those
36	brown creepers!""
36	
36	""You don't mean to say----""
36	
36	""I do.  I'm going on, under their feet.  I've got it planned; I've
36	thought it out.  We men are beat.  We don't know enough.  We've got to
36	learn before we've got a chance.  And we've got to live and keep
36	independent while we learn.  See! That's what has to be done.""
36	
36	I stared, astonished, and stirred profoundly by the man's
36	resolution.
36	
36	""Great God!"" cried I.  ""But you are a man indeed!""  And suddenly I
36	gripped his hand.
36	
36	""Eh!"" he said, with his eyes shining.  ""I've thought it out, eh?""
36	
36	""Go on,"" I said.
36	
36	""Well, those who mean to escape their catching must get ready.  I'm
36	getting ready.  Mind you, it isn't all of us that are made for wild
36	beasts; and that's what it's got to be.  That's why I watched you.  I
36	had my doubts.  You're slender.  I didn't know that it was you, you
36	see, or just how you'd been buried.  All these--the sort of people
36	that lived in these houses, and all those damn little clerks that used
36	to live down that way--they'd be no good.  They haven't any spirit in
36	them--no proud dreams and no proud lusts; and a man who hasn't one or
36	the other--Lord!  What is he but funk and precautions?  They just used
36	to skedaddle off to work--I've seen hundreds of 'em, bit of breakfast
36	in hand, running wild and shining to catch their little season-ticket
36	train, for fear they'd get dismissed if they didn't; working at
36	businesses they were afraid to take the trouble to understand;
36	skedaddling back for fear they wouldn't be in time for dinner; keeping
36	indoors after dinner for fear of the back streets, and sleeping with
36	the wives they married, not because they wanted them, but because they
36	had a bit of money that would make for safety in their one little
36	miserable skedaddle through the world.  Lives insured and a bit
36	invested for fear of accidents.  And on Sundays--fear of the
36	hereafter.  As if hell was built for rabbits!  Well, the Martians will
36	just be a godsend to these.  Nice roomy cages, fattening food, careful
36	breeding, no worry.  After a week or so chasing about the fields and
36	lands on empty stomachs, they'll come and be caught cheerful.  They'll
36	be quite glad after a bit.  They'll wonder what people did before
36	there were Martians to take care of them.  And the bar loafers, and
36	mashers, and singers--I can imagine them.  I can imagine them,"" he
36	said, with a sort of sombre gratification.  ""There'll be any amount of
36	sentiment and religion loose among them.  There's hundreds of things I
36	saw with my eyes that I've only begun to see clearly these last few
36	days.  There's lots will take things as they are--fat and stupid; and
36	lots will be worried by a sort of feeling that it's all wrong, and
36	that they ought to be doing something.  Now whenever things are so
36	that a lot of people feel they ought to be doing something, the weak,
36	and those who go weak with a lot of complicated thinking, always make
36	for a sort of do-nothing religion, very pious and superior, and
36	submit to persecution and the will of the Lord.  Very likely you've
36	seen the same thing.  It's energy in a gale of funk, and turned clean
36	inside out.  These cages will be full of psalms and hymns and piety.
36	And those of a less simple sort will work in a bit of--what is
36	it?--eroticism.""
36	
36	He paused.
36	
36	""Very likely these Martians will make pets of some of them; train
36	them to do tricks--who knows?--get sentimental over the pet boy who
36	grew up and had to be killed.  And some, maybe, they will train to
36	hunt us.""
36	
36	""No,"" I cried, ""that's impossible!  No human being----""
36	
36	""What's the good of going on with such lies?"" said the
36	artilleryman.  ""There's men who'd do it cheerful.  What nonsense to
36	pretend there isn't!""
36	
36	And I succumbed to his conviction.
36	
36	""If they come after me,"" he said; ""Lord, if they come after me!""
36	and subsided into a grim meditation.
36	
36	I sat contemplating these things.  I could find nothing to bring
36	against this man's reasoning.  In the days before the invasion no one
36	would have questioned my intellectual superiority to his--I, a
36	professed and recognised writer on philosophical themes, and he, a
36	common soldier; and yet he had already formulated a situation that I
36	had scarcely realised.
36	
36	""What are you doing?"" I said presently.  ""What plans have you
36	made?""
36	
36	He hesitated.
36	
36	""Well, it's like this,"" he said.  ""What have we to do?  We have to
36	invent a sort of life where men can live and breed, and be
36	sufficiently secure to bring the children up.  Yes--wait a bit, and
36	I'll make it clearer what I think ought to be done.  The tame ones
36	will go like all tame beasts; in a few generations they'll be big,
36	beautiful, rich-blooded, stupid--rubbish! The risk is that we who keep
36	wild will go savage--degenerate into a sort of big, savage rat. . . .
36	You see, how I mean to live is underground.  I've been thinking about
36	the drains.  Of course those who don't know drains think horrible
36	things; but under this London are miles and miles--hundreds of
36	miles--and a few days rain and London empty will leave them sweet and
36	clean. The main drains are big enough and airy enough for anyone.
36	Then there's cellars, vaults, stores, from which bolting passages may
36	be made to the drains. And the railway tunnels and subways.  Eh?  You
36	begin to see?  And we form a band--able-bodied, clean-minded men.
36	We're not going to pick up any rubbish that drifts in.  Weaklings
36	go out again.""
36	
36	""As you meant me to go?""
36	
36	""Well--I parleyed, didn't I?""
36	
36	""We won't quarrel about that.  Go on.""
36	
36	""Those who stop obey orders.  Able-bodied, clean-minded women we
36	want also--mothers and teachers.  No lackadaisical ladies--no blasted
36	rolling eyes.  We can't have any weak or silly.  Life is real again,
36	and the useless and cumbersome and mischievous have to die.  They
36	ought to die.  They ought to be willing to die.  It's a sort of
36	disloyalty, after all, to live and taint the race.  And they can't be
36	happy.  Moreover, dying's none so dreadful; it's the funking makes it
36	bad.  And in all those places we shall gather.  Our district will be
36	London.  And we may even be able to keep a watch, and run about in the
36	open when the Martians keep away.  Play cricket, perhaps.  That's how
36	we shall save the race.  Eh?  It's a possible thing?  But saving the
36	race is nothing in itself.  As I say, that's only being rats.  It's
36	saving our knowledge and adding to it is the thing.  There men like
36	you come in.  There's books, there's models.  We must make great safe
36	places down deep, and get all the books we can; not novels and poetry
36	swipes, but ideas, science books.  That's where men like you come in.
36	We must go to the British Museum and pick all those books through.
36	Especially we must keep up our science--learn more.  We must watch
36	these Martians.  Some of us must go as spies.  When it's all working,
36	perhaps I will.  Get caught, I mean.  And the great thing is, we must
36	leave the Martians alone.  We mustn't even steal.  If we get in their
36	way, we clear out.  We must show them we mean no harm.  Yes, I know.
36	But they're intelligent things, and they won't hunt us down if they
36	have all they want, and think we're just harmless vermin.""
36	
36	The artilleryman paused and laid a brown hand upon my arm.
36	
36	""After all, it may not be so much we may have to learn before--Just
36	imagine this: four or five of their fighting machines suddenly
36	starting off--Heat-Rays right and left, and not a Martian in 'em.  Not
36	a Martian in 'em, but men--men who have learned the way how.  It may
36	be in my time, even--those men.  Fancy having one of them lovely
36	things, with its Heat-Ray wide and free!  Fancy having it in control!
36	What would it matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the
36	run, after a bust like that?  I reckon the Martians'll open their
36	beautiful eyes!  Can't you see them, man?  Can't you see them
36	hurrying, hurrying--puffing and blowing and hooting to their other
36	mechanical affairs?  Something out of gear in every case.  And swish,
36	bang, rattle, swish!  Just as they are fumbling over it, _swish_ comes
36	the Heat-Ray, and, behold! man has come back to his own.""
36	
36	For a while the imaginative daring of the artilleryman, and the
36	tone of assurance and courage he assumed, completely dominated my
36	mind.  I believed unhesitatingly both in his forecast of human destiny
36	and in the practicability of his astonishing scheme, and the reader
36	who thinks me susceptible and foolish must contrast his position,
36	reading steadily with all his thoughts about his subject, and mine,
36	crouching fearfully in the bushes and listening, distracted by
36	apprehension.  We talked in this manner through the early morning
36	time, and later crept out of the bushes, and, after scanning the sky
36	for Martians, hurried precipitately to the house on Putney Hill where
36	he had made his lair.  It was the coal cellar of the place, and when I
36	saw the work he had spent a week upon--it was a burrow scarcely ten
36	yards long, which he designed to reach to the main drain on Putney
36	Hill--I had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his
36	powers.  Such a hole I could have dug in a day.  But I believed in him
36	sufficiently to work with him all that morning until past midday at
36	his digging.  We had a garden barrow and shot the earth we removed
36	against the kitchen range.  We refreshed ourselves with a tin of
36	mock-turtle soup and wine from the neighbouring pantry.  I found a
36	curious relief from the aching strangeness of the world in this steady
36	labour. As we worked, I turned his project over in my mind, and
36	presently objections and doubts began to arise; but I worked there all
36	the morning, so glad was I to find myself with a purpose again.  After
36	working an hour I began to speculate on the distance one had to go
36	before the cloaca was reached, the chances we had of missing it
36	altogether.  My immediate trouble was why we should dig this long
36	tunnel, when it was possible to get into the drain at once down one of
36	the manholes, and work back to the house.  It seemed to me, too, that
36	the house was inconveniently chosen, and required a needless length of
36	tunnel.  And just as I was beginning to face these things, the
36	artilleryman stopped digging, and looked at me.
36	
36	""We're working well,"" he said.  He put down his spade. ""Let us
36	knock off a bit"" he said.  ""I think it's time we reconnoitred from the
36	roof of the house.""
36	
36	I was for going on, and after a little hesitation he resumed his
36	spade; and then suddenly I was struck by a thought.  I stopped, and so
36	did he at once.
36	
36	""Why were you walking about the common,"" I said, ""instead of being
36	here?""
36	
36	""Taking the air,"" he said.  ""I was coming back.  It's safer by
36	night.""
36	
36	""But the work?""
36	
36	""Oh, one can't always work,"" he said, and in a flash I saw the man
36	plain.  He hesitated, holding his spade.  ""We ought to reconnoitre
36	now,"" he said, ""because if any come near they may hear the spades and
36	drop upon us unawares.""
36	
36	I was no longer disposed to object.  We went together to the roof
36	and stood on a ladder peeping out of the roof door.  No Martians were
36	to be seen, and we ventured out on the tiles, and slipped down under
36	shelter of the parapet.
36	
36	From this position a shrubbery hid the greater portion of Putney,
36	but we could see the river below, a bubbly mass of red weed, and the
36	low parts of Lambeth flooded and red.  The red creeper swarmed up the
36	trees about the old palace, and their branches stretched gaunt and
36	dead, and set with shrivelled leaves, from amid its clusters.  It was
36	strange how entirely dependent both these things were upon flowing
36	water for their propagation.  About us neither had gained a footing;
36	laburnums, pink mays, snowballs, and trees of arbor-vitae, rose out of
36	laurels and hydrangeas, green and brilliant into the sunlight.  Beyond
36	Kensington dense smoke was rising, and that and a blue haze hid the
36	northward hills.
36	
36	The artilleryman began to tell me of the sort of people who still
36	remained in London.
36	
36	""One night last week,"" he said, ""some fools got the electric light
36	in order, and there was all Regent Street and the Circus ablaze,
36	crowded with painted and ragged drunkards, men and women, dancing and
36	shouting till dawn.  A man who was there told me.  And as the day came
36	they became aware of a fighting-machine standing near by the Langham
36	and looking down at them.  Heaven knows how long he had been there.
36	It must have given some of them a nasty turn.  He came down the road
36	towards them, and picked up nearly a hundred too drunk or frightened
36	to run away.""
36	
36	Grotesque gleam of a time no history will ever fully describe!
36	
36	From that, in answer to my questions, he came round to his
36	grandiose plans again.  He grew enthusiastic.  He talked so eloquently
36	of the possibility of capturing a fighting-machine that I more than
36	half believed in him again.  But now that I was beginning to
36	understand something of his quality, I could divine the stress he laid
36	on doing nothing precipitately.  And I noted that now there was no
36	question that he personally was to capture and fight the great
36	machine.
36	
36	After a time we went down to the cellar.  Neither of us seemed
36	disposed to resume digging, and when he suggested a meal, I was
36	nothing loath.  He became suddenly very generous, and when we had
36	eaten he went away and returned with some excellent cigars.  We lit
36	these, and his optimism glowed.  He was inclined to regard my coming
36	as a great occasion.
36	
36	""There's some champagne in the cellar,"" he said.
36	
36	""We can dig better on this Thames-side burgundy,"" said I.
36	
36	""No,"" said he; ""I am host today.  Champagne!  Great God! We've a
36	heavy enough task before us!  Let us take a rest and gather strength
36	while we may.  Look at these blistered hands!""
36	
36	And pursuant to this idea of a holiday, he insisted upon playing
36	cards after we had eaten.  He taught me euchre, and after dividing
36	London between us, I taking the northern side and he the southern, we
36	played for parish points.  Grotesque and foolish as this will seem to
36	the sober reader, it is absolutely true, and what is more remarkable,
36	I found the card game and several others we played extremely
36	interesting.
36	
36	Strange mind of man! that, with our species upon the edge of
36	extermination or appalling degradation, with no clear prospect before
36	us but the chance of a horrible death, we could sit following the
36	chance of this painted pasteboard, and playing the ""joker"" with vivid
36	delight.  Afterwards he taught me poker, and I beat him at three tough
36	chess games.  When dark came we decided to take the risk, and lit a
36	lamp.
36	
36	After an interminable string of games, we supped, and the
36	artilleryman finished the champagne.  We went on smoking the cigars.
36	He was no longer the energetic regenerator of his species I had
36	encountered in the morning.  He was still optimistic, but it was a
36	less kinetic, a more thoughtful optimism.  I remember he wound up with
36	my health, proposed in a speech of small variety and considerable
36	intermittence.  I took a cigar, and went upstairs to look at the
36	lights of which he had spoken that blazed so greenly along the
36	Highgate hills.
36	
36	At first I stared unintelligently across the London valley.  The
36	northern hills were shrouded in darkness; the fires near Kensington
36	glowed redly, and now and then an orange-red tongue of flame flashed
36	up and vanished in the deep blue night.  All the rest of London
36	was black.  Then, nearer, I perceived a strange light, a pale,
36	violet-purple fluorescent glow, quivering under the night breeze.  For
36	a space I could not understand it, and then I knew that it must be
36	the red weed from which this faint irradiation proceeded.  With that
36	realisation my dormant sense of wonder, my sense of the proportion of
36	things, awoke again.  I glanced from that to Mars, red and clear,
36	glowing high in the west, and then gazed long and earnestly at the
36	darkness of Hampstead and Highgate.
36	
36	I remained a very long time upon the roof, wondering at the
36	grotesque changes of the day.  I recalled my mental states from the
36	midnight prayer to the foolish card-playing.  I had a violent
36	revulsion of feeling.  I remember I flung away the cigar with a
36	certain wasteful symbolism.  My folly came to me with glaring
36	exaggeration.  I seemed a traitor to my wife and to my kind; I was
36	filled with remorse.  I resolved to leave this strange undisciplined
36	dreamer of great things to his drink and gluttony, and to go on into
36	London.  There, it seemed to me, I had the best chance of learning
36	what the Martians and my fellowmen were doing.  I was still upon the
36	roof when the late moon rose.
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER EIGHT
36	
36	DEAD LONDON
36	
36	
36	After I had parted from the artilleryman, I went down the hill, and
36	by the High Street across the bridge to Fulham.  The red weed was
36	tumultuous at that time, and nearly choked the bridge roadway; but its
36	fronds were already whitened in patches by the spreading disease that
36	presently removed it so swiftly.
36	
36	At the corner of the lane that runs to Putney Bridge station I
36	found a man lying.  He was as black as a sweep with the black dust,
36	alive, but helplessly and speechlessly drunk.  I could get nothing
36	from him but curses and furious lunges at my head.  I think I should
36	have stayed by him but for the brutal expression of his face.
36	
36	There was black dust along the roadway from the bridge onwards, and
36	it grew thicker in Fulham.  The streets were horribly quiet.  I got
36	food--sour, hard, and mouldy, but quite eatable--in a baker's shop
36	here.  Some way towards Walham Green the streets became clear of
36	powder, and I passed a white terrace of houses on fire; the noise of
36	the burning was an absolute relief.  Going on towards Brompton, the
36	streets were quiet again.
36	
36	Here I came once more upon the black powder in the streets and upon
36	dead bodies.  I saw altogether about a dozen in the length of the
36	Fulham Road.  They had been dead many days, so that I hurried quickly
36	past them.  The black powder covered them over, and softened their
36	outlines.  One or two had been disturbed by dogs.
36	
36	Where there was no black powder, it was curiously like a Sunday in
36	the City, with the closed shops, the houses locked up and the blinds
36	drawn, the desertion, and the stillness.  In some places plunderers
36	had been at work, but rarely at other than the provision and wine
36	shops.  A jeweller's window had been broken open in one place, but
36	apparently the thief had been disturbed, and a number of gold chains
36	and a watch lay scattered on the pavement.  I did not trouble to touch
36	them.  Farther on was a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep; the
36	hand that hung over her knee was gashed and bled down her rusty brown
36	dress, and a smashed magnum of champagne formed a pool across the
36	pavement.  She seemed asleep, but she was dead.
36	
36	The farther I penetrated into London, the profounder grew the
36	stillness.  But it was not so much the stillness of death--it was the
36	stillness of suspense, of expectation.  At any time the destruction
36	that had already singed the northwestern borders of the metropolis,
36	and had annihilated Ealing and Kilburn, might strike among these
36	houses and leave them smoking ruins.  It was a city condemned and
36	derelict. . . .
36	
36	In South Kensington the streets were clear of dead and of black
36	powder.  It was near South Kensington that I first heard the howling.
36	It crept almost imperceptibly upon my senses.  It was a sobbing
36	alternation of two notes, ""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" keeping on
36	perpetually.  When I passed streets that ran northward it grew in
36	volume, and houses and buildings seemed to deaden and cut it off
36	again.  It came in a full tide down Exhibition Road.  I stopped,
36	staring towards Kensington Gardens, wondering at this strange, remote
36	wailing.  It was as if that mighty desert of houses had found a voice
36	for its fear and solitude.
36	
36	""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" wailed that superhuman note--great waves
36	of sound sweeping down the broad, sunlit roadway, between the tall
36	buildings on each side.  I turned northwards, marvelling, towards the
36	iron gates of Hyde Park.  I had half a mind to break into the Natural
36	History Museum and find my way up to the summits of the towers, in
36	order to see across the park.  But I decided to keep to the ground,
36	where quick hiding was possible, and so went on up the Exhibition
36	Road.  All the large mansions on each side of the road were empty and
36	still, and my footsteps echoed against the sides of the houses.  At
36	the top, near the park gate, I came upon a strange sight--a bus
36	overturned, and the skeleton of a horse picked clean.  I puzzled over
36	this for a time, and then went on to the bridge over the Serpentine.
36	The voice grew stronger and stronger, though I could see nothing above
36	the housetops on the north side of the park, save a haze of smoke to
36	the northwest.
36	
36	""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" cried the voice, coming, as it seemed to
36	me, from the district about Regent's Park.  The desolating cry worked
36	upon my mind.  The mood that had sustained me passed.  The wailing
36	took possession of me.  I found I was intensely weary, footsore, and
36	now again hungry and thirsty.
36	
36	It was already past noon.  Why was I wandering alone in this city
36	of the dead?  Why was I alone when all London was lying in state, and
36	in its black shroud?  I felt intolerably lonely.  My mind ran on old
36	friends that I had forgotten for years.  I thought of the poisons in
36	the chemists' shops, of the liquors the wine merchants stored; I
36	recalled the two sodden creatures of despair, who so far as I knew,
36	shared the city with myself. . . .
36	
36	I came into Oxford Street by the Marble Arch, and here again were
36	black powder and several bodies, and an evil, ominous smell from the
36	gratings of the cellars of some of the houses.  I grew very thirsty
36	after the heat of my long walk.  With infinite trouble I managed to
36	break into a public-house and get food and drink.  I was weary after
36	eating, and went into the parlour behind the bar, and slept on a black
36	horsehair sofa I found there.
36	
36	I awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears, ""Ulla, ulla,
36	ulla, ulla.""  It was now dusk, and after I had routed out some
36	biscuits and a cheese in the bar--there was a meat safe, but it
36	contained nothing but maggots--I wandered on through the silent
36	residential squares to Baker Street--Portman Square is the only one I
36	can name--and so came out at last upon Regent's Park.  And as I
36	emerged from the top of Baker Street, I saw far away over the trees in
36	the clearness of the sunset the hood of the Martian giant from which
36	this howling proceeded.  I was not terrified.  I came upon him as if
36	it were a matter of course.  I watched him for some time, but he did
36	not move.  He appeared to be standing and yelling, for no reason that
36	I could discover.
36	
36	I tried to formulate a plan of action.  That perpetual sound of
36	""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" confused my mind.  Perhaps I was too tired
36	to be very fearful.  Certainly I was more curious to know the reason
36	of this monotonous crying than afraid.  I turned back away from the
36	park and struck into Park Road, intending to skirt the park, went
36	along under the shelter of the terraces, and got a view of this
36	stationary, howling Martian from the direction of St. John's Wood.  A
36	couple of hundred yards out of Baker Street I heard a yelping chorus,
36	and saw, first a dog with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jaws
36	coming headlong towards me, and then a pack of starving mongrels in
36	pursuit of him.  He made a wide curve to avoid me, as though he feared
36	I might prove a fresh competitor.  As the yelping died away down the
36	silent road, the wailing sound of ""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" reasserted
36	itself.
36	
36	I came upon the wrecked handling-machine halfway to St. John's Wood
36	station.  At first I thought a house had fallen across the road.  It
36	was only as I clambered among the ruins that I saw, with a start, this
36	mechanical Samson lying, with its tentacles bent and smashed and
36	twisted, among the ruins it had made.  The forepart was shattered.  It
36	seemed as if it had driven blindly straight at the house, and had been
36	overwhelmed in its overthrow.  It seemed to me then that this might
36	have happened by a handling-machine escaping from the guidance of its
36	Martian.  I could not clamber among the ruins to see it, and the
36	twilight was now so far advanced that the blood with which its seat
36	was smeared, and the gnawed gristle of the Martian that the dogs had
36	left, were invisible to me.
36	
36	Wondering still more at all that I had seen, I pushed on towards
36	Primrose Hill.  Far away, through a gap in the trees, I saw a second
36	Martian, as motionless as the first, standing in the park towards the
36	Zoological Gardens, and silent.  A little beyond the ruins about the
36	smashed handling-machine I came upon the red weed again, and found the
36	Regent's Canal, a spongy mass of dark-red vegetation.
36	
36	As I crossed the bridge, the sound of ""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,""
36	ceased.  It was, as it were, cut off.  The silence came like a
36	thunderclap.
36	
36	The dusky houses about me stood faint and tall and dim; the trees
36	towards the park were growing black.  All about me the red weed
36	clambered among the ruins, writhing to get above me in the dimness.
36	Night, the mother of fear and mystery, was coming upon me.  But while
36	that voice sounded the solitude, the desolation, had been endurable;
36	by virtue of it London had still seemed alive, and the sense of life
36	about me had upheld me.  Then suddenly a change, the passing of
36	something--I knew not what--and then a stillness that could be felt.
36	Nothing but this gaunt quiet.
36	
36	London about me gazed at me spectrally.  The windows in the white
36	houses were like the eye sockets of skulls.  About me my imagination
36	found a thousand noiseless enemies moving.  Terror seized me, a horror
36	of my temerity.  In front of me the road became pitchy black as though
36	it was tarred, and I saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway.  I
36	could not bring myself to go on.  I turned down St. John's Wood Road,
36	and ran headlong from this unendurable stillness towards Kilburn.  I
36	hid from the night and the silence, until long after midnight, in a
36	cabmen's shelter in Harrow Road.  But before the dawn my courage
36	returned, and while the stars were still in the sky I turned once more
36	towards Regent's Park.  I missed my way among the streets, and
36	presently saw down a long avenue, in the half-light of the early dawn,
36	the curve of Primrose Hill.  On the summit, towering up to the fading
36	stars, was a third Martian, erect and motionless like the others.
36	
36	An insane resolve possessed me.  I would die and end it.  And I
36	would save myself even the trouble of killing myself.  I marched on
36	recklessly towards this Titan, and then, as I drew nearer and the
36	light grew, I saw that a multitude of black birds was circling and
36	clustering about the hood.  At that my heart gave a bound, and I began
36	running along the road.
36	
36	I hurried through the red weed that choked St. Edmund's Terrace (I
36	waded breast-high across a torrent of water that was rushing down from
36	the waterworks towards the Albert Road), and emerged upon the grass
36	before the rising of the sun.  Great mounds had been heaped about the
36	crest of the hill, making a huge redoubt of it--it was the final and
36	largest place the Martians had made--and from behind these heaps there
36	rose a thin smoke against the sky.  Against the sky line an eager dog
36	ran and disappeared.  The thought that had flashed into my mind grew
36	real, grew credible.  I felt no fear, only a wild, trembling
36	exultation, as I ran up the hill towards the motionless monster.  Out
36	of the hood hung lank shreds of brown, at which the hungry birds
36	pecked and tore.
36	
36	In another moment I had scrambled up the earthen rampart and stood
36	upon its crest, and the interior of the redoubt was below me.  A
36	mighty space it was, with gigantic machines here and there within it,
36	huge mounds of material and strange shelter places.  And scattered
36	about it, some in their overturned war-machines, some in the now rigid
36	handling-machines, and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a
36	row, were the Martians--_dead_!--slain by the putrefactive and disease
36	bacteria against which their systems were unprepared; slain as the red
36	weed was being slain; slain, after all man's devices had failed, by
36	the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this earth.
36	
36	For so it had come about, as indeed I and many men might have
36	foreseen had not terror and disaster blinded our minds.  These
36	germs of disease have taken toll of humanity since the beginning of
36	things--taken toll of our prehuman ancestors since life began here.
36	But by virtue of this natural selection of our kind we have developed
36	resisting power; to no germs do we succumb without a struggle, and to
36	many--those that cause putrefaction in dead matter, for instance--our
36	living frames are altogether immune.  But there are no bacteria in
36	Mars, and directly these invaders arrived, directly they drank and
36	fed, our microscopic allies began to work their overthrow.  Already
36	when I watched them they were irrevocably doomed, dying and rotting
36	even as they went to and fro.  It was inevitable.  By the toll of a
36	billion deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth, and it is
36	his against all comers; it would still be his were the Martians ten
36	times as mighty as they are.  For neither do men live nor die in vain.
36	
36	Here and there they were scattered, nearly fifty altogether, in
36	that great gulf they had made, overtaken by a death that must have
36	seemed to them as incomprehensible as any death could be.  To me also
36	at that time this death was incomprehensible.  All I knew was that
36	these things that had been alive and so terrible to men were dead.
36	For a moment I believed that the destruction of Sennacherib had been
36	repeated, that God had repented, that the Angel of Death had slain
36	them in the night.
36	
36	I stood staring into the pit, and my heart lightened gloriously,
36	even as the rising sun struck the world to fire about me with his
36	rays.  The pit was still in darkness; the mighty engines, so great and
36	wonderful in their power and complexity, so unearthly in their
36	tortuous forms, rose weird and vague and strange out of the shadows
36	towards the light.  A multitude of dogs, I could hear, fought over the
36	bodies that lay darkly in the depth of the pit, far below me.  Across
36	the pit on its farther lip, flat and vast and strange, lay the great
36	flying-machine with which they had been experimenting upon our denser
36	atmosphere when decay and death arrested them.  Death had come not a
36	day too soon.  At the sound of a cawing overhead I looked up at the
36	huge fighting-machine that would fight no more for ever, at the
36	tattered red shreds of flesh that dripped down upon the overturned
36	seats on the summit of Primrose Hill.
36	
36	I turned and looked down the slope of the hill to where, enhaloed
36	now in birds, stood those other two Martians that I had seen
36	overnight, just as death had overtaken them.  The one had died, even
36	as it had been crying to its companions; perhaps it was the last to
36	die, and its voice had gone on perpetually until the force of its
36	machinery was exhausted.  They glittered now, harmless tripod towers
36	of shining metal, in the brightness of the rising sun.
36	
36	All about the pit, and saved as by a miracle from everlasting
36	destruction, stretched the great Mother of Cities.  Those who have only
36	seen London veiled in her sombre robes of smoke can scarcely imagine
36	the naked clearness and beauty of the silent wilderness of houses.
36	
36	Eastward, over the blackened ruins of the Albert Terrace and the
36	splintered spire of the church, the sun blazed dazzling in a clear
36	sky, and here and there some facet in the great wilderness of roofs
36	caught the light and glared with a white intensity.
36	
36	Northward were Kilburn and Hampsted, blue and crowded with houses;
36	westward the great city was dimmed; and southward, beyond the
36	Martians, the green waves of Regent's Park, the Langham Hotel, the
36	dome of the Albert Hall, the Imperial Institute, and the giant
36	mansions of the Brompton Road came out clear and little in the
36	sunrise, the jagged ruins of Westminster rising hazily beyond.  Far
36	away and blue were the Surrey hills, and the towers of the Crystal
36	Palace glittered like two silver rods.  The dome of St. Paul's was
36	dark against the sunrise, and injured, I saw for the first time, by a
36	huge gaping cavity on its western side.
36	
36	And as I looked at this wide expanse of houses and factories and
36	churches, silent and abandoned; as I thought of the multitudinous
36	hopes and efforts, the innumerable hosts of lives that had gone to
36	build this human reef, and of the swift and ruthless destruction that
36	had hung over it all; when I realised that the shadow had been rolled
36	back, and that men might still live in the streets, and this dear vast
36	dead city of mine be once more alive and powerful, I felt a wave of
36	emotion that was near akin to tears.
36	
36	The torment was over.  Even that day the healing would begin.  The
36	survivors of the people scattered over the country--leaderless,
36	lawless, foodless, like sheep without a shepherd--the thousands who
36	had fled by sea, would begin to return; the pulse of life, growing
36	stronger and stronger, would beat again in the empty streets and pour
36	across the vacant squares.  Whatever destruction was done, the hand of
36	the destroyer was stayed.  All the gaunt wrecks, the blackened
36	skeletons of houses that stared so dismally at the sunlit grass of the
36	hill, would presently be echoing with the hammers of the restorers and
36	ringing with the tapping of their trowels.  At the thought I extended
36	my hands towards the sky and began thanking God.  In a year, thought
36	I--in a year. . .
36	
36	With overwhelming force came the thought of myself, of my wife, and
36	the old life of hope and tender helpfulness that had ceased for ever.
36	
36	
36	
36	CHAPTER NINE
36	
36	WRECKAGE
36	
36	
36	And now comes the strangest thing in my story.  Yet, perhaps, it is
36	not altogether strange.  I remember, clearly and coldly and vividly,
36	all that I did that day until the time that I stood weeping and
36	praising God upon the summit of Primrose Hill.  And then I forget.
36	
36	Of the next three days I know nothing.  I have learned since that,
36	so far from my being the first discoverer of the Martian overthrow,
36	several such wanderers as myself had already discovered this on the
36	previous night.  One man--the first--had gone to St. Martin's-le-Grand,
36	and, while I sheltered in the cabmen's hut, had contrived to
36	telegraph to Paris.  Thence the joyful news had flashed all over the
36	world; a thousand cities, chilled by ghastly apprehensions, suddenly
36	flashed into frantic illuminations; they knew of it in Dublin,
36	Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, at the time when I stood upon the
36	verge of the pit.  Already men, weeping with joy, as I have heard,
36	shouting and staying their work to shake hands and shout, were making
36	up trains, even as near as Crewe, to descend upon London.  The church
36	bells that had ceased a fortnight since suddenly caught the news,
36	until all England was bell-ringing.  Men on cycles, lean-faced,
36	unkempt, scorched along every country lane shouting of unhoped
36	deliverance, shouting to gaunt, staring figures of despair.  And for
36	the food!  Across the Channel, across the Irish Sea, across the
36	Atlantic, corn, bread, and meat were tearing to our relief.  All the
36	shipping in the world seemed going Londonward in those days.  But of
36	all this I have no memory.  I drifted--a demented man.  I found myself
36	in a house of kindly people, who had found me on the third day
36	wandering, weeping, and raving through the streets of St. John's Wood.
36	They have told me since that I was singing some insane doggerel about
36	""The Last Man Left Alive! Hurrah!  The Last Man Left Alive!""  Troubled
36	as they were with their own affairs, these people, whose name, much as
36	I would like to express my gratitude to them, I may not even give
36	here, nevertheless cumbered themselves with me, sheltered me, and
36	protected me from myself.  Apparently they had learned something of my
36	story from me during the days of my lapse.
36	
36	Very gently, when my mind was assured again, did they break to me
36	what they had learned of the fate of Leatherhead.  Two days after I
36	was imprisoned it had been destroyed, with every soul in it, by a
36	Martian.  He had swept it out of existence, as it seemed, without any
36	provocation, as a boy might crush an ant hill, in the mere wantonness
36	of power.
36	
36	I was a lonely man, and they were very kind to me.  I was a lonely
36	man and a sad one, and they bore with me.  I remained with them four
36	days after my recovery.  All that time I felt a vague, a growing
36	craving to look once more on whatever remained of the little life that
36	seemed so happy and bright in my past.  It was a mere hopeless desire
36	to feast upon my misery.  They dissuaded me.  They did all they could
36	to divert me from this morbidity.  But at last I could resist the
36	impulse no longer, and, promising faithfully to return to them, and
36	parting, as I will confess, from these four-day friends with tears, I
36	went out again into the streets that had lately been so dark and
36	strange and empty.
36	
36	Already they were busy with returning people; in places even there
36	were shops open, and I saw a drinking fountain running water.
36	
36	I remember how mockingly bright the day seemed as I went back on my
36	melancholy pilgrimage to the little house at Woking, how busy the
36	streets and vivid the moving life about me.  So many people were
36	abroad everywhere, busied in a thousand activities, that it seemed
36	incredible that any great proportion of the population could have been
36	slain.  But then I noticed how yellow were the skins of the people I
36	met, how shaggy the hair of the men, how large and bright their eyes,
36	and that every other man still wore his dirty rags.  Their faces
36	seemed all with one of two expressions--a leaping exultation and
36	energy or a grim resolution.  Save for the expression of the faces,
36	London seemed a city of tramps.  The vestries were indiscriminately
36	distributing bread sent us by the French government.  The ribs of the
36	few horses showed dismally.  Haggard special constables with white
36	badges stood at the corners of every street.  I saw little of the
36	mischief wrought by the Martians until I reached Wellington Street,
36	and there I saw the red weed clambering over the buttresses of
36	Waterloo Bridge.
36	
36	At the corner of the bridge, too, I saw one of the common contrasts
36	of that grotesque time--a sheet of paper flaunting against a thicket
36	of the red weed, transfixed by a stick that kept it in place.  It was
36	the placard of the first newspaper to resume publication--the _Daily
36	Mail_.  I bought a copy for a blackened shilling I found in my pocket.
36	Most of it was in blank, but the solitary compositor who did the thing
36	had amused himself by making a grotesque scheme of advertisement
36	stereo on the back page.  The matter he printed was emotional; the
36	news organisation had not as yet found its way back.  I learned
36	nothing fresh except that already in one week the examination of the
36	Martian mechanisms had yielded astonishing results.  Among other
36	things, the article assured me what I did not believe at the time,
36	that the ""Secret of Flying,"" was discovered.  At Waterloo I found the
36	free trains that were taking people to their homes.  The first rush
36	was already over.  There were few people in the train, and I was in no
36	mood for casual conversation.  I got a compartment to myself, and sat
36	with folded arms, looking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed
36	past the windows.  And just outside the terminus the train jolted over
36	temporary rails, and on either side of the railway the houses were
36	blackened ruins.  To Clapham Junction the face of London was grimy
36	with powder of the Black Smoke, in spite of two days of thunderstorms
36	and rain, and at Clapham Junction the line had been wrecked again;
36	there were hundreds of out-of-work clerks and shopmen working side by
36	side with the customary navvies, and we were jolted over a hasty
36	relaying.
36	
36	All down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt
36	and unfamiliar; Wimbledon particularly had suffered.  Walton, by virtue
36	of its unburned pine woods, seemed the least hurt of any place along
36	the line.  The Wandle, the Mole, every little stream, was a heaped
36	mass of red weed, in appearance between butcher's meat and pickled
36	cabbage.  The Surrey pine woods were too dry, however, for the festoons
36	of the red climber.  Beyond Wimbledon, within sight of the line, in
36	certain nursery grounds, were the heaped masses of earth about the
36	sixth cylinder.  A number of people were standing about it, and some
36	sappers were busy in the midst of it.  Over it flaunted a Union Jack,
36	flapping cheerfully in the morning breeze.  The nursery grounds were
36	everywhere crimson with the weed, a wide expanse of livid colour cut
36	with purple shadows, and very painful to the eye.  One's gaze went
36	with infinite relief from the scorched greys and sullen reds of the
36	foreground to the blue-green softness of the eastward hills.
36	
36	The line on the London side of Woking station was still undergoing
36	repair, so I descended at Byfleet station and took the road to
36	Maybury, past the place where I and the artilleryman had talked to the
36	hussars, and on by the spot where the Martian had appeared to me in
36	the thunderstorm.  Here, moved by curiosity, I turned aside to find,
36	among a tangle of red fronds, the warped and broken dog cart with the
36	whitened bones of the horse scattered and gnawed.  For a time I stood
36	regarding these vestiges. . . .
36	
36	Then I returned through the pine wood, neck-high with red weed here
36	and there, to find the landlord of the Spotted Dog had already found
36	burial, and so came home past the College Arms.  A man standing at an
36	open cottage door greeted me by name as I passed.
36	
36	I looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that faded
36	immediately.  The door had been forced; it was unfast and was opening
36	slowly as I approached.
36	
36	It slammed again.  The curtains of my study fluttered out of the
36	open window from which I and the artilleryman had watched the dawn.  No
36	one had closed it since.  The smashed bushes were just as I had left
36	them nearly four weeks ago.  I stumbled into the hall, and the house
36	felt empty.  The stair carpet was ruffled and discoloured where I had
36	crouched, soaked to the skin from the thunderstorm the night of the
36	catastrophe.  Our muddy footsteps I saw still went up the stairs.
36	
36	I followed them to my study, and found lying on my writing-table
36	still, with the selenite paper weight upon it, the sheet of work I had
36	left on the afternoon of the opening of the cylinder.  For a space I
36	stood reading over my abandoned arguments.  It was a paper on the
36	probable development of Moral Ideas with the development of the
36	civilising process; and the last sentence was the opening of a
36	prophecy: ""In about two hundred years,"" I had written, ""we may
36	expect----""  The sentence ended abruptly.  I remembered my inability
36	to fix my mind that morning, scarcely a month gone by, and how I had
36	broken off to get my _Daily Chronicle_ from the newsboy.  I remembered
36	how I went down to the garden gate as he came along, and how I had
36	listened to his odd story of ""Men from Mars.""
36	
36	I came down and went into the dining room.  There were the mutton
36	and the bread, both far gone now in decay, and a beer bottle
36	overturned, just as I and the artilleryman had left them.  My home was
36	desolate.  I perceived the folly of the faint hope I had cherished so
36	long.  And then a strange thing occurred.  ""It is no use,"" said a
36	voice.  ""The house is deserted.  No one has been here these ten days.
36	Do not stay here to torment yourself.  No one escaped but you.""
36	
36	I was startled.  Had I spoken my thought aloud?  I turned, and the
36	French window was open behind me.  I made a step to it, and stood
36	looking out.
36	
36	And there, amazed and afraid, even as I stood amazed and afraid,
36	were my cousin and my wife--my wife white and tearless.  She gave a
36	faint cry.
36	
36	""I came,"" she said.  ""I knew--knew----""
36	
36	She put her hand to her throat--swayed.  I made a step forward, and
36	caught her in my arms.

36	CHAPTER TEN
36	
36	THE EPILOGUE
36	
36	
36	I cannot but regret, now that I am concluding my story, how little
36	I am able to contribute to the discussion of the many debatable
36	questions which are still unsettled.  In one respect I shall certainly
36	provoke criticism.  My particular province is speculative philosophy.
36	My knowledge of comparative physiology is confined to a book or two,
36	but it seems to me that Carver's suggestions as to the reason of the
36	rapid death of the Martians is so probable as to be regarded almost as
36	a proven conclusion.  I have assumed that in the body of my narrative.
36	
36	At any rate, in all the bodies of the Martians that were examined
36	after the war, no bacteria except those already known as terrestrial
36	species were found.  That they did not bury any of their dead, and the
36	reckless slaughter they perpetrated, point also to an entire ignorance
36	of the putrefactive process.  But probable as this seems, it is by no
36	means a proven conclusion.
36	
36	Neither is the composition of the Black Smoke known, which the
36	Martians used with such deadly effect, and the generator of the
36	Heat-Rays remains a puzzle.  The terrible disasters at the Ealing
36	and South Kensington laboratories have disinclined analysts for further
36	investigations upon the latter.  Spectrum analysis of the black powder
36	points unmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with a
36	brilliant group of three lines in the green, and it is possible that
36	it combines with argon to form a compound which acts at once with
36	deadly effect upon some constituent in the blood.  But such unproven
36	speculations will scarcely be of interest to the general reader, to
36	whom this story is addressed.  None of the brown scum that drifted
36	down the Thames after the destruction of Shepperton was examined at
36	the time, and now none is forthcoming.
36	
36	The results of an anatomical examination of the Martians, so far
36	as the prowling dogs had left such an examination possible, I have
36	already given.  But everyone is familiar with the magnificent and
36	almost complete specimen in spirits at the Natural History Museum, and
36	the countless drawings that have been made from it; and beyond that
36	the interest of their physiology and structure is purely scientific.
36	
36	A question of graver and universal interest is the possibility of
36	another attack from the Martians.  I do not think that nearly enough
36	attention is being given to this aspect of the matter.  At present the
36	planet Mars is in conjunction, but with every return to opposition I,
36	for one, anticipate a renewal of their adventure.  In any case, we
36	should be prepared.  It seems to me that it should be possible to
36	define the position of the gun from which the shots are discharged, to
36	keep a sustained watch upon this part of the planet, and to anticipate
36	the arrival of the next attack.
36	
36	In that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite or
36	artillery before it was sufficiently cool for the Martians to emerge,
36	or they might be butchered by means of guns so soon as the screw
36	opened.  It seems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in the
36	failure of their first surprise.  Possibly they see it in the same
36	light.
36	
36	Lessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the
36	Martians have actually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet
36	Venus.  Seven months ago now, Venus and Mars were in alignment with
36	the sun; that is to say, Mars was in opposition from the point of view
36	of an observer on Venus.  Subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous
36	marking appeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet, and
36	almost simultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character
36	was detected upon a photograph of the Martian disk.  One needs to see
36	the drawings of these appearances in order to appreciate fully their
36	remarkable resemblance in character.
36	
36	At any rate, whether we expect another invasion or not, our views
36	of the human future must be greatly modified by these events.  We have
36	learned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and a
36	secure abiding place for Man; we can never anticipate the unseen good
36	or evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space.  It may be that
36	in the larger design of the universe this invasion from Mars is not
36	without its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us of that serene
36	confidence in the future which is the most fruitful source of
36	decadence, the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous, and
36	it has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal of
36	mankind.  It may be that across the immensity of space the Martians
36	have watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their
36	lesson, and that on the planet Venus they have found a securer
36	settlement.  Be that as it may, for many years yet there will
36	certainly be no relaxation of the eager scrutiny of the Martian disk,
36	and those fiery darts of the sky, the shooting stars, will bring with
36	them as they fall an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men.
36	
36	The broadening of men's views that has resulted can scarcely be
36	exaggerated.  Before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion
36	that through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the petty
36	surface of our minute sphere.  Now we see further.  If the Martians
36	can reach Venus, there is no reason to suppose that the thing is
36	impossible for men, and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this
36	earth uninhabitable, as at last it must do, it may be that the thread
36	of life that has begun here will have streamed out and caught our
36	sister planet within its toils.
36	
36	Dim and wonderful is the vision I have conjured up in my mind of
36	life spreading slowly from this little seed bed of the solar system
36	throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space.  But that is a
36	remote dream.  It may be, on the other hand, that the destruction of
36	the Martians is only a reprieve.  To them, and not to us, perhaps, is
36	the future ordained.
36	
36	I must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an
36	abiding sense of doubt and insecurity in my mind.  I sit in my study
36	writing by lamplight, and suddenly I see again the healing valley
36	below set with writhing flames, and feel the house behind and about me
36	empty and desolate.  I go out into the Byfleet Road, and vehicles pass
36	me, a butcher boy in a cart, a cabful of visitors, a workman on a
36	bicycle, children going to school, and suddenly they become vague and
36	unreal, and I hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot,
36	brooding silence.  Of a night I see the black powder darkening the
36	silent streets, and the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer; they
36	rise upon me tattered and dog-bitten.  They gibber and grow fiercer,
36	paler, uglier, mad distortions of humanity at last, and I wake, cold
36	and wretched, in the darkness of the night.
36	
36	I go to London and see the busy multitudes in Fleet Street and the
36	Strand, and it comes across my mind that they are but the ghosts of
36	the past, haunting the streets that I have seen silent and wretched,
36	going to and fro, phantasms in a dead city, the mockery of life in a
36	galvanised body.  And strange, too, it is to stand on Primrose Hill,
36	as I did but a day before writing this last chapter, to see the great
36	province of houses, dim and blue through the haze of the smoke and
36	mist, vanishing at last into the vague lower sky, to see the people
36	walking to and fro among the flower beds on the hill, to see the
36	sight-seers about the Martian machine that stands there still, to hear
36	the tumult of playing children, and to recall the time when I saw it
36	all bright and clear-cut, hard and silent, under the dawn of that last
36	great day. . . .
36	
36	And strangest of all is it to hold my wife's hand again, and to think
36	that I have counted her, and that she has counted me, among the dead.

159	INTRODUCTION.
159	
159	ON February the First 1887, the Lady Vain was lost by collision
159	with a derelict when about the latitude 1 degree S. and longitude
159	107 degrees W.
159	
159	On January the Fifth, 1888--that is eleven months and four days after--my
159	uncle, Edward Prendick, a private gentleman, who certainly went
159	aboard the Lady Vain at Callao, and who had been considered drowned,
159	was picked up in latitude 5 degrees 3' S. and longitude 101 degrees W.
159	in a small open boat of which the name was illegible, but which is
159	supposed to have belonged to the missing schooner Ipecacuanha.
159	He gave such a strange account of himself that he was supposed demented.
159	Subsequently he alleged that his mind was a blank from the moment
159	of his escape from the Lady Vain.  His case was discussed among
159	psychologists at the time as a curious instance of the lapse
159	of memory consequent upon physical and mental stress.
159	The following narrative was found among his papers by the undersigned,
159	his nephew and heir, but unaccompanied by any definite request
159	for publication.
159	
159	The only island known to exist in the region in which my uncle was
159	picked up is Noble's Isle, a small volcanic islet and uninhabited.
159	It was visited in 1891 by H. M. S. Scorpion.  A party of sailors
159	then landed, but found nothing living thereon except certain curious
159	white moths, some hogs and rabbits, and some rather peculiar rats.
159	So that this narrative is without confirmation in its most
159	essential particular.  With that understood, there seems no harm
159	in putting this strange story before the public in accordance,
159	as I believe, with my uncle's intentions.  There is at least this
159	much in its behalf:  my uncle passed out of human knowledge about
159	latitude 5 degrees S. and longitude 105 degrees E., and reappeared
159	in the same part of the ocean after a space of eleven months.
159	In some way he must have lived during the interval.  And it seems that
159	a schooner called the Ipecacuanha with a drunken captain, John Davies,
159	did start from Africa with a puma and certain other animals aboard
159	in January, 1887, that the vessel was well known at several ports
159	in the South Pacific, and that it finally disappeared from those seas
159	(with a considerable amount of copra aboard), sailing to its unknown
159	fate from Bayna in December, 1887, a date that tallies entirely with my
159	uncle's story.
159	
159	CHARLES EDWARD PRENDICK.
159	
159	(The Story written by Edward Prendick.)
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	I.  IN THE DINGEY OF THE ""LADY VAIN.""
159	
159	
159	I DO not propose to add anything to what has already been written
159	concerning the loss of the ""Lady Vain.""  As everyone knows,
159	she collided with a derelict when ten days out from Callao.
159	The longboat, with seven of the crew, was picked up eighteen days after
159	by H. M. gunboat ""Myrtle,"" and the story of their terrible privations
159	has become quite as well known as the far more horrible ""Medusa"" case.
159	But I have to add to the published story of the ""Lady Vain""
159	another, possibly as horrible and far stranger.  It has hitherto
159	been supposed that the four men who were in the dingey perished,
159	but this is incorrect.  I have the best of evidence for this assertion:
159	I was one of the four men.
159	
159	But in the first place I must state that there never were four men
159	in the dingey,--the number was three.  Constans, who was ""seen
159	by the captain to jump into the gig,""{1} luckily for us and unluckily
159	for himself did not reach us.  He came down out of the tangle
159	of ropes under the stays of the smashed bowsprit, some small rope
159	caught his heel as he let go, and he hung for a moment head downward,
159	and then fell and struck a block or spar floating in the water.
159	We pulled towards him, but he never came up.
159	
159	{1} Daily News, March 17, 1887.
159	
159	I say luckily for us he did not reach us, and I might almost
159	say luckily for himself; for we had only a small beaker
159	of water and some soddened ship's biscuits with us, so sudden
159	had been the alarm, so unprepared the ship for any disaster.
159	We thought the people on the launch would be better provisioned
159	(though it seems they were not), and we tried to hail them.  They could
159	not have heard us, and the next morning when the drizzle cleared,--which
159	was not until past midday,--we could see nothing of them.  We could
159	not stand up to look about us, because of the pitching of the boat.
159	The two other men who had escaped so far with me were a man named Helmar,
159	a passenger like myself, and a seaman whose name I don't know,--a short
159	sturdy man, with a stammer.
159	
159	We drifted famishing, and, after our water had come to an end,
159	tormented by an intolerable thirst, for eight days altogether.
159	After the second day the sea subsided slowly to a glassy calm.  It is
159	quite impossible for the ordinary reader to imagine those eight days.
159	He has not, luckily for himself, anything in his memory to imagine with.
159	After the first day we said little to one another, and lay
159	in our places in the boat and stared at the horizon, or watched,
159	with eyes that grew larger and more haggard every day, the misery
159	and weakness gaining upon our companions.  The sun became pitiless.
159	The water ended on the fourth day, and we were already thinking
159	strange things and saying them with our eyes; but it was, I think,
159	the sixth before Helmar gave voice to the thing we had all been thinking.
159	I remember our voices were dry and thin, so that we bent towards
159	one another and spared our words.  I stood out against it with all
159	my might, was rather for scuttling the boat and perishing together
159	among the sharks that followed us; but when Helmar said that if his
159	proposal was accepted we should have drink, the sailor came round
159	to him.
159	
159	I would not draw lots however, and in the night the sailor whispered
159	to Helmar again and again, and I sat in the bows with my clasp-knife
159	in my hand, though I doubt if I had the stuff in me to fight;
159	and in the morning I agreed to Helmar's proposal, and we handed
159	halfpence to find the odd man.  The lot fell upon the sailor;
159	but he was the strongest of us and would not abide by it, and attacked
159	Helmar with his hands.  They grappled together and almost stood up.
159	I crawled along the boat to them, intending to help Helmar by grasping
159	the sailor's leg; but the sailor stumbled with the swaying of the boat,
159	and the two fell upon the gunwale and rolled overboard together.
159	They sank like stones.  I remember laughing at that, and wondering
159	why I laughed.  The laugh caught me suddenly like a thing
159	from without.
159	
159	I lay across one of the thwarts for I know not how long,
159	thinking that if I had the strength I would drink sea-water
159	and madden myself to die quickly.  And even as I lay there I saw,
159	with no more interest than if it had been a picture, a sail come
159	up towards me over the sky-line. My mind must have been wandering,
159	and yet I remember all that happened, quite distinctly.
159	I remember how my head swayed with the seas, and the horizon
159	with the sail above it danced up and down; but I also remember
159	as distinctly that I had a persuasion that I was dead, and that I
159	thought what a jest it was that they should come too late by such
159	a little to catch me in my body.
159	
159	For an endless period, as it seemed to me, I lay with my head
159	on the thwart watching the schooner (she was a little ship,
159	schooner-rigged fore and aft) come up out of the sea.
159	She kept tacking to and fro in a widening compass, for she was
159	sailing dead into the wind.  It never entered my head to attempt
159	to attract attention, and I do not remember anything distinctly after
159	the sight of her side until I found myself in a little cabin aft.
159	There's a dim half-memory of being lifted up to the gangway, and of
159	a big round countenance covered with freckles and surrounded with red
159	hair staring at me over the bulwarks.  I also had a disconnected
159	impression of a dark face, with extraordinary eyes, close to mine;
159	but that I thought was a nightmare, until I met it again.
159	I fancy I recollect some stuff being poured in between my teeth;
159	and that is all.
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	II.  THE MAN WHO WAS GOING NOWHERE.
159	
159	
159	THE cabin in which I found myself was small and rather untidy.
159	A youngish man with flaxen hair, a bristly straw-coloured moustache,
159	and a dropping nether lip, was sitting and holding my wrist.
159	For a minute we stared at each other without speaking.
159	He had watery grey eyes, oddly void of expression.
159	Then just overhead came a sound like an iron bedstead being
159	knocked about, and the low angry growling of some large animal.
159	At the same time the man spoke.  He repeated his question,--""How do you
159	feel now?""
159	
159	I think I said I felt all right.  I could not recollect how I
159	had got there.  He must have seen the question in my face,
159	for my voice was inaccessible to me.
159	
159	""You were picked up in a boat, starving.  The name on the boat
159	was the 'Lady Vain,' and there were spots of blood on the gunwale.""
159	
159	At the same time my eye caught my hand, so thin that it looked
159	like a dirty skin-purse full of loose bones, and all the business
159	of the boat came back to me.
159	
159	""Have some of this,"" said he, and gave me a dose of some
159	scarlet stuff, iced.
159	
159	It tasted like blood, and made me feel stronger.
159	
159	""You were in luck,"" said he, ""to get picked up by a ship with a
159	medical man aboard.""  He spoke with a slobbering articulation,
159	with the ghost of a lisp.
159	
159	""What ship is this?""  I said slowly, hoarse from my long silence.
159	
159	""It's a little trader from Arica and Callao.  I never asked
159	where she came from in the beginning,--out of the land
159	of born fools, I guess.  I'm a passenger myself, from Arica.
159	The silly ass who owns her,--he's captain too, named Davies,--he's
159	lost his certificate, or something.  You know the kind of man,--calls
159	the thing the 'Ipecacuanha,' of all silly, infernal names;
159	though when there's much of a sea without any wind, she certainly
159	acts according.""
159	
159	(Then the noise overhead began again, a snarling growl
159	and the voice of a human being together.  Then another voice,
159	telling some ""Heaven-forsaken idiot"" to desist.)
159	
159	""You were nearly dead,"" said my interlocutor.  ""It was a very
159	near thing, indeed.  But I've put some stuff into you now.
159	Notice your arm's sore?  Injections.  You've been insensible for nearly
159	thirty hours.""
159	
159	I thought slowly.  (I was distracted now by the yelping of a number
159	of dogs.) ""Am I eligible for solid food?"" I asked.
159	
159	""Thanks to me,"" he said.  ""Even now the mutton is boiling.""
159	
159	""Yes,"" I said with assurance; ""I could eat some mutton.""
159	
159	""But,"" said he with a momentary hesitation, ""you know I'm dying to hear
159	of how you came to be alone in that boat.  Damn that howling!""
159	I thought I detected a certain suspicion in his eyes.
159	
159	He suddenly left the cabin, and I heard him in violent controversy
159	with some one, who seemed to me to talk gibberish in response to him.
159	The matter sounded as though it ended in blows, but in that I thought
159	my ears were mistaken.  Then he shouted at the dogs, and returned to
159	the cabin.
159	
159	""Well?"" said he in the doorway.  ""You were just beginning to tell me.""
159	
159	I told him my name, Edward Prendick, and how I had taken to Natural
159	History as a relief from the dulness of my comfortable independence.
159	
159	He seemed interested in this.  ""I've done some science myself.  I did
159	my Biology at University College,--getting out the ovary of the earthworm
159	and the radula of the snail, and all that.  Lord!  It's ten years ago.
159	But go on! go on! tell me about the boat.""
159	
159	He was evidently satisfied with the frankness of my story,
159	which I told in concise sentences enough, for I felt horribly weak;
159	and when it was finished he reverted at once to the topic
159	of Natural History and his own biological studies.  He began to
159	question me closely about Tottenham Court Road and Gower Street.
159	""Is Caplatzi still flourishing?  What a shop that was!""
159	He had evidently been a very ordinary medical student, and drifted
159	incontinently to the topic of the music halls.  He told me
159	some anecdotes.
159	
159	""Left it all,"" he said, ""ten years ago.  How jolly it all used to be!
159	But I made a young ass of myself,--played myself out before I was
159	twenty-one. I daresay it's all different now.  But I must look up
159	that ass of a cook, and see what he's done to your mutton.""
159	
159	The growling overhead was renewed, so suddenly and with so much savage
159	anger that it startled me.  ""What's that?""  I called after him,
159	but the door had closed.  He came back again with the boiled mutton,
159	and I was so excited by the appetising smell of it that I forgot
159	the noise of the beast that had troubled me.
159	
159	After a day of alternate sleep and feeding I was so far recovered
159	as to be able to get from my bunk to the scuttle, and see the green
159	seas trying to keep pace with us.  I judged the schooner was running
159	before the wind.  Montgomery--that was the name of the flaxen-haired
159	man--came in again as I stood there, and I asked him for some clothes.
159	He lent me some duck things of his own, for those I had worn in the boat
159	had been thrown overboard.  They were rather loose for me, for he was
159	large and long in his limbs.  He told me casually that the captain
159	was three-parts drunk in his own cabin.  As I assumed the clothes,
159	I began asking him some questions about the destination of the ship.
159	He said the ship was bound to Hawaii, but that it had to land
159	him first.
159	
159	""Where?"" said I.
159	
159	""It's an island, where I live.  So far as I know, it hasn't got
159	a name.""
159	
159	He stared at me with his nether lip dropping, and looked so wilfully
159	stupid of a sudden that it came into my head that he desired
159	to avoid my questions.  I had the discretion to ask no more.
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	III.  THE STRANGE FACE.
159	
159	
159	WE left the cabin and found a man at the companion obstructing
159	our way.  He was standing on the ladder with his back to us,
159	peering over the combing of the hatchway.  He was, I could see,
159	a misshapen man, short, broad, and clumsy, with a crooked back,
159	a hairy neck, and a head sunk between his shoulders.  He was dressed
159	in dark-blue serge, and had peculiarly thick, coarse, black hair.
159	I heard the unseen dogs growl furiously, and forthwith he ducked
159	back,--coming into contact with the hand I put out to fend him off
159	from myself.  He turned with animal swiftness.
159	
159	In some indefinable way the black face thus flashed upon me
159	shocked me profoundly.  It was a singularly deformed one.
159	The facial part projected, forming something dimly suggestive
159	of a muzzle, and the huge half-open mouth showed as big white teeth
159	as I had ever seen in a human mouth.  His eyes were blood-shot
159	at the edges, with scarcely a rim of white round the hazel pupils.
159	There was a curious glow of excitement in his face.
159	
159	""Confound you!"" said Montgomery.  ""Why the devil don't you get
159	out of the way?""
159	
159	The black-faced man started aside without a word.
159	I went on up the companion, staring at him instinctively
159	as I did so.  Montgomery stayed at the foot for a moment.
159	""You have no business here, you know,"" he said in a deliberate tone.
159	""Your place is forward.""
159	
159	The black-faced man cowered.  ""They--won't have me forward.""
159	He spoke slowly, with a queer, hoarse quality in his voice.
159	
159	""Won't have you forward!"" said Montgomery, in a menacing voice.
159	""But I tell you to go!""  He was on the brink of saying something further,
159	then looked up at me suddenly and followed me up the ladder.
159	
159	I had paused half way through the hatchway, looking back, still astonished
159	beyond measure at the grotesque ugliness of this black-faced creature.
159	I had never beheld such a repulsive and extraordinary face before,
159	and yet--if the contradiction is credible--I experienced at
159	the same time an odd feeling that in some way I _had_ already
159	encountered exactly the features and gestures that now amazed me.
159	Afterwards it occurred to me that probably I had seen him as I
159	was lifted aboard; and yet that scarcely satisfied my suspicion
159	of a previous acquaintance.  Yet how one could have set eyes on
159	so singular a face and yet have forgotten the precise occasion,
159	passed my imagination.
159	
159	Montgomery's movement to follow me released my attention, and I
159	turned and looked about me at the flush deck of the little schooner.
159	I was already half prepared by the sounds I had heard for what I saw.
159	Certainly I never beheld a deck so dirty.  It was littered with
159	scraps of carrot, shreds of green stuff, and indescribable filth.
159	Fastened by chains to the mainmast were a number of grisly staghounds,
159	who now began leaping and barking at me, and by the mizzen a huge puma was
159	cramped in a little iron cage far too small even to give it turning room.
159	Farther under the starboard bulwark were some big hutches containing
159	a number of rabbits, and a solitary llama was squeezed in a mere
159	box of a cage forward.  The dogs were muzzled by leather straps.
159	The only human being on deck was a gaunt and silent sailor at
159	the wheel.
159	
159	The patched and dirty spankers were tense before the wind,
159	and up aloft the little ship seemed carrying every sail she had.
159	The sky was clear, the sun midway down the western sky;
159	long waves, capped by the breeze with froth, were running with us.
159	We went past the steersman to the taffrail, and saw the water come
159	foaming under the stern and the bubbles go dancing and vanishing
159	in her wake.  I turned and surveyed the unsavoury length of
159	the ship.
159	
159	""Is this an ocean menagerie?"" said I.
159	
159	""Looks like it,"" said Montgomery.
159	
159	""What are these beasts for?  Merchandise, curios?  Does the captain
159	think he is going to sell them somewhere in the South Seas?""
159	
159	""It looks like it, doesn't it?"" said Montgomery, and turned towards
159	the wake again.
159	
159	Suddenly we heard a yelp and a volley of furious blasphemy
159	from the companion hatchway, and the deformed man with the black
159	face came up hurriedly.  He was immediately followed by a heavy
159	red-haired man in a white cap.  At the sight of the former
159	the staghounds, who had all tired of barking at me by this time,
159	became furiously excited, howling and leaping against their chains.
159	The black hesitated before them, and this gave the red-haired man
159	time to come up with him and deliver a tremendous blow between
159	the shoulder-blades. The poor devil went down like a felled ox,
159	and rolled in the dirt among the furiously excited dogs.
159	It was lucky for him that they were muzzled.  The red-haired man gave
159	a yawp of exultation and stood staggering, and as it seemed to me
159	in serious danger of either going backwards down the companion hatchway
159	or forwards upon his victim.
159	
159	So soon as the second man had appeared, Montgomery had started forward.
159	""Steady on there!"" he cried, in a tone of remonstrance.
159	A couple of sailors appeared on the forecastle.  The black-faced man,
159	howling in a singular voice rolled about under the feet of the dogs.
159	No one attempted to help him.  The brutes did their best to worry him,
159	butting their muzzles at him.  There was a quick dance of their
159	lithe grey-figured bodies over the clumsy, prostrate figure.
159	The sailors forward shouted, as though it was admirable sport.
159	Montgomery gave an angry exclamation, and went striding down
159	the deck, and I followed him.  The black-faced man scrambled
159	up and staggered forward, going and leaning over the bulwark
159	by the main shrouds, where he remained, panting and glaring
159	over his shoulder at the dogs.  The red-haired man laughed a
159	satisfied laugh.
159	
159	""Look here, Captain,"" said Montgomery, with his lisp a little accentuated,
159	gripping the elbows of the red-haired man, ""this won't do!""
159	
159	I stood behind Montgomery.  The captain came half round,
159	and regarded him with the dull and solemn eyes of a drunken man.
159	""Wha' won't do?"" he said, and added, after looking sleepily into
159	Montgomery's face for a minute, ""Blasted Sawbones!""
159	
159	With a sudden movement he shook his arms free, and after two
159	ineffectual attempts stuck his freckled fists into his side pockets.
159	
159	""That man's a passenger,"" said Montgomery.  ""I'd advise you to keep
159	your hands off him.""
159	
159	""Go to hell!"" said the captain, loudly.  He suddenly turned
159	and staggered towards the side.  ""Do what I like on my own ship,""
159	he said.
159	
159	I think Montgomery might have left him then, seeing the brute was drunk;
159	but he only turned a shade paler, and followed the captain
159	to the bulwarks.
159	
159	""Look you here, Captain,"" he said; ""that man of mine is not to be
159	ill-treated. He has been hazed ever since he came aboard.""
159	
159	For a minute, alcoholic fumes kept the captain speechless.
159	""Blasted Sawbones!"" was all he considered necessary.
159	
159	I could see that Montgomery had one of those slow, pertinacious tempers
159	that will warm day after day to a white heat, and never again
159	cool to forgiveness; and I saw too that this quarrel had been
159	some time growing.  ""The man's drunk,"" said I, perhaps officiously;
159	""you'll do no good.""
159	
159	Montgomery gave an ugly twist to his dropping lip.  ""He's always drunk.
159	Do you think that excuses his assaulting his passengers?""
159	
159	""My ship,"" began the captain, waving his hand unsteadily
159	towards the cages, ""was a clean ship.  Look at it now!""
159	It was certainly anything but clean.  ""Crew,"" continued the captain,
159	""clean, respectable crew.""
159	
159	""You agreed to take the beasts.""
159	
159	""I wish I'd never set eyes on your infernal island.  What the
159	devil--want beasts for on an island like that?  Then, that man of
159	yours--understood he was a man.  He's a lunatic; and he hadn't no
159	business aft.  Do you think the whole damned ship belongs to you?""
159	
159	""Your sailors began to haze the poor devil as soon as he came aboard.""
159	
159	""That's just what he is--he's a devil! an ugly devil!  My men
159	can't stand him.  _I_ can't stand him.  None of us can't stand him.
159	Nor _you_ either!""
159	
159	Montgomery turned away.  ""_You_ leave that man alone, anyhow,"" he said,
159	nodding his head as he spoke.
159	
159	But the captain meant to quarrel now.  He raised his voice.  ""If he comes
159	this end of the ship again I'll cut his insides out, I tell you.
159	Cut out his blasted insides!  Who are you, to tell me what I'm to do?
159	I tell you I'm captain of this ship,--captain and owner.
159	I'm the law here, I tell you,--the law and the prophets.
159	I bargained to take a man and his attendant to and from Arica,
159	and bring back some animals.  I never bargained to carry a mad devil
159	and a silly Sawbones, a--""
159	
159	Well, never mind what he called Montgomery.  I saw the latter take
159	a step forward, and interposed.  ""He's drunk,"" said I. The captain
159	began some abuse even fouler than the last.  ""Shut up!"" I said,
159	turning on him sharply, for I had seen danger in Montgomery's white face.
159	With that I brought the downpour on myself.
159	
159	However, I was glad to avert what was uncommonly near a scuffle,
159	even at the price of the captain's drunken ill-will. I do not think
159	I have ever heard quite so much vile language come in a continuous
159	stream from any man's lips before, though I have frequented eccentric
159	company enough.  I found some of it hard to endure, though I am
159	a mild-tempered man; but, certainly, when I told the captain to
159	""shut up"" I had forgotten that I was merely a bit of human flotsam,
159	cut off from my resources and with my fare unpaid; a mere casual
159	dependant on the bounty, or speculative enterprise, of the ship.
159	He reminded me of it with considerable vigour; but at any rate I prevented
159	a fight.
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	IV.  AT THE SCHOONER'S RAIL.
159	
159	
159	THAT night land was sighted after sundown, and the schooner
159	hove to.  Montgomery intimated that was his destination.
159	It was too far to see any details; it seemed to me then simply
159	a low-lying patch of dim blue in the uncertain blue-grey sea.
159	An almost vertical streak of smoke went up from it into the sky.
159	The captain was not on deck when it was sighted.  After he had vented
159	his wrath on me he had staggered below, and I understand he went to sleep
159	on the floor of his own cabin.  The mate practically assumed the command.
159	He was the gaunt, taciturn individual we had seen at the wheel.
159	Apparently he was in an evil temper with Montgomery.  He took
159	not the slightest notice of either of us.  We dined with him in a
159	sulky silence, after a few ineffectual efforts on my part to talk.
159	It struck me too that the men regarded my companion and his animals
159	in a singularly unfriendly manner.  I found Montgomery very reticent
159	about his purpose with these creatures, and about his destination;
159	and though I was sensible of a growing curiosity as to both, I did not
159	press him.
159	
159	We remained talking on the quarter deck until the sky was thick
159	with stars.  Except for an occasional sound in the yellow-lit forecastle
159	and a movement of the animals now and then, the night was very still.
159	The puma lay crouched together, watching us with shining eyes, a black
159	heap in the corner of its cage.  Montgomery produced some cigars.
159	He talked to me of London in a tone of half-painful reminiscence,
159	asking all kinds of questions about changes that had taken place.
159	He spoke like a man who had loved his life there, and had been
159	suddenly and irrevocably cut off from it.  I gossiped as well as I
159	could of this and that.  All the time the strangeness of him was
159	shaping itself in my mind; and as I talked I peered at his odd,
159	pallid face in the dim light of the binnacle lantern behind me.  Then I
159	looked out at the darkling sea, where in the dimness his little island
159	was hidden.
159	
159	This man, it seemed to me, had come out of Immensity merely to save
159	my life.  To-morrow he would drop over the side, and vanish again out
159	of my existence.  Even had it been under commonplace circumstances,
159	it would have made me a trifle thoughtful; but in the first place was
159	the singularity of an educated man living on this unknown little island,
159	and coupled with that the extraordinary nature of his luggage.
159	I found myself repeating the captain's question. What did he want
159	with the beasts?  Why, too, had he pretended they were not his when I
159	had remarked about them at first?  Then, again, in his personal attendant
159	there was a bizarre quality which had impressed me profoundly.
159	These circumstances threw a haze of mystery round the man.  They laid
159	hold of my imagination, and hampered my tongue.
159	
159	Towards midnight our talk of London died away, and we stood
159	side by side leaning over the bulwarks and staring dreamily
159	over the silent, starlit sea, each pursuing his own thoughts.
159	It was the atmosphere for sentiment, and I began upon my gratitude.
159	
159	""If I may say it,"" said I, after a time, ""you have saved my life.""
159	
159	""Chance,"" he answered.  ""Just chance.""
159	
159	""I prefer to make my thanks to the accessible agent.""
159	
159	""Thank no one.  You had the need, and I had the knowledge;
159	and I injected and fed you much as I might have collected a specimen.
159	I was bored and wanted something to do.  If I'd been jaded that day,
159	or hadn't liked your face, well--it's a curious question where you would
159	have been now!""
159	
159	This damped my mood a little.  ""At any rate,"" I began.
159	
159	""It's a chance, I tell you,"" he interrupted, ""as everything is in
159	a man's life.  Only the asses won't see it!  Why am I here now,
159	an outcast from civilisation, instead of being a happy man enjoying
159	all the pleasures of London?  Simply because eleven years ago--I
159	lost my head for ten minutes on a foggy night.""
159	
159	He stopped.  ""Yes?"" said I.
159	
159	""That's all.""
159	
159	We relapsed into silence.  Presently he laughed.
159	""There's something in this starlight that loosens one's tongue.
159	I'm an ass, and yet somehow I would like to tell you.""
159	
159	""Whatever you tell me, you may rely upon my keeping to myself--if
159	that's it.""
159	
159	He was on the point of beginning, and then shook his head, doubtfully.
159	
159	""Don't,"" said I.  ""It is all the same to me.  After all, it is better
159	to keep your secret.  There's nothing gained but a little relief
159	if I respect your confidence.  If I don't--well?""
159	
159	He grunted undecidedly.  I felt I had him at a disadvantage, had caught
159	him in the mood of indiscretion; and to tell the truth I was not curious
159	to learn what might have driven a young medical student out of London.
159	I have an imagination.  I shrugged my shoulders and turned away.
159	Over the taffrail leant a silent black figure, watching the stars.
159	It was Montgomery's strange attendant.  It looked over its shoulder
159	quickly with my movement, then looked away again.
159	
159	It may seem a little thing to you, perhaps, but it came like a sudden
159	blow to me.  The only light near us was a lantern at the wheel.
159	The creature's face was turned for one brief instant out of the dimness
159	of the stern towards this illumination, and I saw that the eyes
159	that glanced at me shone with a pale-green light.  I did not know then
159	that a reddish luminosity, at least, is not uncommon in human eyes.
159	The thing came to me as stark inhumanity.  That black figure with its
159	eyes of fire struck down through all my adult thoughts and feelings,
159	and for a moment the forgotten horrors of childhood came back to my mind.
159	Then the effect passed as it had come.  An uncouth black figure
159	of a man, a figure of no particular import, hung over the taffrail
159	against the starlight, and I found Montgomery was speaking
159	to me.
159	
159	""I'm thinking of turning in, then,"" said he, ""if you've had enough
159	of this.""
159	
159	I answered him incongruously.  We went below, and he wished me
159	good-night at the door of my cabin.
159	
159	That night I had some very unpleasant dreams.  The waning
159	moon rose late.  Its light struck a ghostly white beam across
159	my cabin, and made an ominous shape on the planking by my bunk.
159	Then the staghounds woke, and began howling and baying;
159	so that I dreamt fitfully, and scarcely slept until the approach
159	of dawn.
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	V.  THE MAN WHO HAD NOWHERE TO GO.
159	
159	
159	IN the early morning (it was the second morning after my recovery,
159	and I believe the fourth after I was picked up), I awoke through an avenue
159	of tumultuous dreams,--dreams of guns and howling mobs,--and became
159	sensible of a hoarse shouting above me.  I rubbed my eyes and lay
159	listening to the noise, doubtful for a little while of my whereabouts.
159	Then came a sudden pattering of bare feet, the sound of heavy objects
159	being thrown about, a violent creaking and the rattling of chains.
159	I heard the swish of the water as the ship was suddenly brought round,
159	and a foamy yellow-green wave flew across the little round
159	window and left it streaming.  I jumped into my clothes and went
159	on deck.
159	
159	As I came up the ladder I saw against the flushed sky--for the sun
159	was just rising--the broad back and red hair of the captain,
159	and over his shoulder the puma spinning from a tackle rigged on
159	to the mizzen spanker-boom.
159	
159	The poor brute seemed horribly scared, and crouched in the bottom
159	of its little cage.
159	
159	""Overboard with 'em!"" bawled the captain.  ""Overboard with 'em!
159	We'll have a clean ship soon of the whole bilin' of 'em.""
159	
159	He stood in my way, so that I had perforce to tap his shoulder
159	to come on deck.  He came round with a start, and staggered back
159	a few paces to stare at me.  It needed no expert eye to tell
159	that the man was still drunk.
159	
159	""Hullo!"" said he, stupidly; and then with a light coming into his eyes,
159	""Why, it's Mister--Mister?""
159	
159	""Prendick,"" said I.
159	
159	""Prendick be damned!"" said he.  ""Shut-up,--that's your name.
159	Mister Shut-up.""
159	
159	It was no good answering the brute; but I certainly did not expect
159	his next move.  He held out his hand to the gangway by which Montgomery
159	stood talking to a massive grey-haired man in dirty-blue flannels,
159	who had apparently just come aboard.
159	
159	""That way, Mister Blasted Shut-up! that way!"" roared the captain.
159	
159	Montgomery and his companion turned as he spoke.
159	
159	""What do you mean?""  I said.
159	
159	""That way, Mister Blasted Shut-up,--that's what I mean!
159	Overboard, Mister Shut-up,--and sharp!  We're cleaning the ship
159	out,--cleaning the whole blessed ship out; and overboard you go!""
159	
159	I stared at him dumfounded.  Then it occurred to me that it was
159	exactly the thing I wanted.  The lost prospect of a journey as sole
159	passenger with this quarrelsome sot was not one to mourn over.
159	I turned towards Montgomery.
159	
159	""Can't have you,"" said Montgomery's companion, concisely.
159	
159	""You can't have me!"" said I, aghast.  He had the squarest and most
159	resolute face I ever set eyes upon.
159	
159	""Look here,"" I began, turning to the captain.
159	
159	""Overboard!"" said the captain.  ""This ship aint for beasts
159	and cannibals and worse than beasts, any more.  Overboard you go,
159	Mister Shut-up. If they can't have you, you goes overboard.
159	But, anyhow, you go--with your friends.  I've done with this blessed
159	island for evermore, amen!  I've had enough of it.""
159	
159	""But, Montgomery,"" I appealed.
159	
159	He distorted his lower lip, and nodded his head hopelessly at
159	the grey-haired man beside him, to indicate his powerlessness to help me.
159	
159	""I'll see to _you_, presently,"" said the captain.
159	
159	Then began a curious three-cornered altercation.
159	Alternately I appealed to one and another of the three men,--first
159	to the grey-haired man to let me land, and then to the drunken
159	captain to keep me aboard.  I even bawled entreaties to the sailors.
159	Montgomery said never a word, only shook his head.
159	""You're going overboard, I tell you,"" was the captain's refrain.
159	""Law be damned!  I'm king here.""  At last I must confess
159	my voice suddenly broke in the middle of a vigorous threat.
159	I felt a gust of hysterical petulance, and went aft and stared dismally
159	at nothing.
159	
159	Meanwhile the sailors progressed rapidly with the task of
159	unshipping the packages and caged animals.  A large launch,
159	with two standing lugs, lay under the lee of the schooner;
159	and into this the strange assortment of goods were swung.
159	I did not then see the hands from the island that were receiving
159	the packages, for the hull of the launch was hidden from me
159	by the side of the schooner.  Neither Montgomery nor his companion
159	took the slightest notice of me, but busied themselves in assisting
159	and directing the four or five sailors who were unloading the goods.
159	The captain went forward interfering rather than assisting.
159	I was alternately despairful and desperate.  Once or twice
159	as I stood waiting there for things to accomplish themselves,
159	I could not resist an impulse to laugh at my miserable quandary.
159	I felt all the wretcheder for the lack of a breakfast.
159	Hunger and a lack of blood-corpuscles take all the manhood from a man.
159	I perceived pretty clearly that I had not the stamina
159	either to resist what the captain chose to do to expel me,
159	or to force myself upon Montgomery and his companion.
159	So I waited passively upon fate; and the work of transferring
159	Montgomery's possessions to the launch went on as if I did
159	not exist.
159	
159	Presently that work was finished, and then came a struggle.
159	I was hauled, resisting weakly enough, to the gangway.
159	Even then I noticed the oddness of the brown faces of the men who were
159	with Montgomery in the launch; but the launch was now fully laden,
159	and was shoved off hastily.  A broadening gap of green water
159	appeared under me, and I pushed back with all my strength to avoid
159	falling headlong.  The hands in the launch shouted derisively,
159	and I heard Montgomery curse at them; and then the captain,
159	the mate, and one of the seamen helping him, ran me aft towards
159	the stern.
159	
159	The dingey of the ""Lady Vain"" had been towing behind; it was
159	half full of water, had no oars, and was quite unvictualled.
159	I refused to go aboard her, and flung myself full length on the deck.
159	In the end, they swung me into her by a rope (for they had no
159	stern ladder), and then they cut me adrift.  I drifted slowly
159	from the schooner.  In a kind of stupor I watched all hands take
159	to the rigging, and slowly but surely she came round to the wind;
159	the sails fluttered, and then bellied out as the wind came into them.
159	I stared at her weather-beaten side heeling steeply towards me;
159	and then she passed out of my range of view.
159	
159	I did not turn my head to follow her.  At first I could scarcely
159	believe what had happened.  I crouched in the bottom of the dingey,
159	stunned, and staring blankly at the vacant, oily sea.  Then I realised
159	that I was in that little hell of mine again, now half swamped;
159	and looking back over the gunwale, I saw the schooner standing away
159	from me, with the red-haired captain mocking at me over the taffrail,
159	and turning towards the island saw the launch growing smaller as she
159	approached the beach.
159	
159	Abruptly the cruelty of this desertion became clear to me.
159	I had no means of reaching the land unless I should chance to drift there.
159	I was still weak, you must remember, from my exposure in the boat;
159	I was empty and very faint, or I should have had more heart.
159	But as it was I suddenly began to sob and weep, as I had never done
159	since I was a little child.  The tears ran down my face.  In a passion
159	of despair I struck with my fists at the water in the bottom of the boat,
159	and kicked savagely at the gunwale.  I prayed aloud for God to let
159	me die.
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	VI.  THE EVIL-LOOKING BOATMEN.
159	
159	
159	BUT the islanders, seeing that I was really adrift, took pity on me.
159	I drifted very slowly to the eastward, approaching the island slantingly;
159	and presently I saw, with hysterical relief, the launch come round and
159	return towards me.  She was heavily laden, and I could make out as she
159	drew nearer Montgomery's white-haired, broad-shouldered companion sitting
159	cramped up with the dogs and several packing-cases in the stern sheets.
159	This individual stared fixedly at me without moving or speaking.
159	The black-faced cripple was glaring at me as fixedly in the bows
159	near the puma.  There were three other men besides,--three strange
159	brutish-looking fellows, at whom the staghounds were snarling savagely.
159	Montgomery, who was steering, brought the boat by me, and rising,
159	caught and fastened my painter to the tiller to tow me, for there was no
159	room aboard.
159	
159	I had recovered from my hysterical phase by this time
159	and answered his hail, as he approached, bravely enough.
159	I told him the dingey was nearly swamped, and he reached me a piggin.
159	I was jerked back as the rope tightened between the boats.
159	For some time I was busy baling.
159	
159	It was not until I had got the water under (for the water
159	in the dingey had been shipped; the boat was perfectly sound)
159	that I had leisure to look at the people in the launch again.
159	
159	The white-haired man I found was still regarding me steadfastly,
159	but with an expression, as I now fancied, of some perplexity.
159	When my eyes met his, he looked down at the staghound that sat
159	between his knees.  He was a powerfully-built man, as I have said,
159	with a fine forehead and rather heavy features; but his eyes
159	had that odd drooping of the skin above the lids which often
159	comes with advancing years, and the fall of his heavy mouth
159	at the corners gave him an expression of pugnacious resolution.
159	He talked to Montgomery in a tone too low for me to hear.
159	
159	From him my eyes travelled to his three men; and a strange crew they were.
159	I saw only their faces, yet there was something in their
159	faces--I knew not what--that gave me a queer spasm of disgust.
159	I looked steadily at them, and the impression did not pass,
159	though I failed to see what had occasioned it.  They seemed
159	to me then to be brown men; but their limbs were oddly swathed
159	in some thin, dirty, white stuff down even to the fingers and feet:
159	I have never seen men so wrapped up before, and women so only in the East.
159	They wore turbans too, and thereunder peered out their elfin
159	faces at me,--faces with protruding lower-jaws and bright eyes.
159	They had lank black hair, almost like horsehair, and seemed
159	as they sat to exceed in stature any race of men I have seen.
159	The white-haired man, who I knew was a good six feet in height,
159	sat a head below any one of the three.  I found afterwards that really
159	none were taller than myself; but their bodies were abnormally long,
159	and the thigh-part of the leg short and curiously twisted.
159	At any rate, they were an amazingly ugly gang, and over the heads
159	of them under the forward lug peered the black face of the man whose
159	eyes were luminous in the dark.  As I stared at them, they met my gaze;
159	and then first one and then another turned away from my direct stare,
159	and looked at me in an odd, furtive manner.  It occurred to me that I
159	was perhaps annoying them, and I turned my attention to the island
159	we were approaching.
159	
159	It was low, and covered with thick vegetation,--chiefly a kind of palm,
159	that was new to me.  From one point a thin white thread of vapour rose
159	slantingly to an immense height, and then frayed out like a down feather.
159	We were now within the embrace of a broad bay flanked on either
159	hand by a low promontory.  The beach was of dull-grey sand,
159	and sloped steeply up to a ridge, perhaps sixty or seventy feet above
159	the sea-level, and irregularly set with trees and undergrowth.
159	Half way up was a square enclosure of some greyish stone, which I found
159	subsequently was built partly of coral and partly of pumiceous lava.
159	Two thatched roofs peeped from within this enclosure.
159	A man stood awaiting us at the water's edge.  I fancied while we
159	were still far off that I saw some other and very grotesque-looking
159	creatures scuttle into the bushes upon the slope; but I saw nothing
159	of these as we drew nearer.  This man was of a moderate size,
159	and with a black negroid face.  He had a large, almost lipless,
159	mouth, extraordinary lank arms, long thin feet, and bow-legs,
159	and stood with his heavy face thrust forward staring at us.
159	He was dressed like Montgomery and his white-haired companion,
159	in jacket and trousers of blue serge.  As we came still nearer,
159	this individual began to run to and fro on the beach, making the most
159	grotesque movements.
159	
159	At a word of command from Montgomery, the four men in the launch
159	sprang up, and with singularly awkward gestures struck the lugs.
159	Montgomery steered us round and into a narrow little dock excavated
159	in the beach.  Then the man on the beach hastened towards us.
159	This dock, as I call it, was really a mere ditch just long
159	enough at this phase of the tide to take the longboat.
159	I heard the bows ground in the sand, staved the dingey off the rudder
159	of the big boat with my piggin, and freeing the painter, landed.
159	The three muffled men, with the clumsiest movements, scrambled out
159	upon the sand, and forthwith set to landing the cargo, assisted by
159	the man on the beach.  I was struck especially by the curious
159	movements of the legs of the three swathed and bandaged boatmen,--not
159	stiff they were, but distorted in some odd way, almost as if they
159	were jointed in the wrong place.  The dogs were still snarling,
159	and strained at their chains after these men, as the white-haired
159	man landed with them.  The three big fellows spoke to one another
159	in odd guttural tones, and the man who had waited for us on
159	the beach began chattering to them excitedly--a foreign language,
159	as I fancied--as they laid hands on some bales piled near the stern.
159	Somewhere I had heard such a voice before, and I could not think where.
159	The white-haired man stood, holding in a tumult of six dogs, and bawling
159	orders over their din.  Montgomery, having unshipped the rudder,
159	landed likewise, and all set to work at unloading.  I was too faint,
159	what with my long fast and the sun beating down on my bare head, to offer
159	any assistance.
159	
159	Presently the white-haired man seemed to recollect my presence,
159	and came up to me.
159	
159	""You look,"" said he, ""as though you had scarcely breakfasted.""
159	His little eyes were a brilliant black under his heavy brows.
159	""I must apologise for that.  Now you are our guest, we must
159	make you comfortable,--though you are uninvited, you know.""
159	He looked keenly into my face.  ""Montgomery says you are an educated man,
159	Mr. Prendick; says you know something of science.  May I ask what
159	that signifies?""
159	
159	I told him I had spent some years at the Royal College of Science,
159	and had done some researches in biology under Huxley.  He raised
159	his eyebrows slightly at that.
159	
159	""That alters the case a little, Mr. Prendick,"" he said,
159	with a trifle more respect in his manner.  ""As it happens,
159	we are biologists here.  This is a biological station--of a sort.""
159	His eye rested on the men in white who were busily hauling the puma,
159	on rollers, towards the walled yard.  ""I and Montgomery, at least,""
159	he added.  Then, ""When you will be able to get away, I can't say.
159	We're off the track to anywhere.  We see a ship once in a twelve-month
159	or so.""
159	
159	He left me abruptly, and went up the beach past this group, and I
159	think entered the enclosure.  The other two men were with Montgomery,
159	erecting a pile of smaller packages on a low-wheeled truck.
159	The llama was still on the launch with the rabbit hutches;
159	the staghounds were still lashed to the thwarts.
159	The pile of things completed, all three men laid hold of the truck
159	and began shoving the ton-weight or so upon it after the puma.
159	Presently Montgomery left them, and coming back to me held out
159	his hand.
159	
159	""I'm glad,"" said he, ""for my own part.  That captain was a silly ass.
159	He'd have made things lively for you.""
159	
159	""It was you,"" said I, ""that saved me again.""
159	
159	""That depends.  You'll find this island an infernally rum place,
159	I promise you.  I'd watch my goings carefully, if I were you.
159	_He_--"" He hesitated, and seemed to alter his mind about what
159	was on his lips.  ""I wish you'd help me with these rabbits,""
159	he said.
159	
159	His procedure with the rabbits was singular.  I waded
159	in with him, and helped him lug one of the hutches ashore.
159	No sooner was that done than he opened the door of it, and tilting
159	the thing on one end turned its living contents out on the ground.
159	They fell in a struggling heap one on the top of the other.
159	He clapped his hands, and forthwith they went off with that hopping
159	run of theirs, fifteen or twenty of them I should think, up
159	the beach.
159	
159	""Increase and multiply, my friends,"" said Montgomery.
159	""Replenish the island.  Hitherto we've had a certain lack of meat here.""
159	
159	As I watched them disappearing, the white-haired man returned with a
159	brandy-flask and some biscuits.  ""Something to go on with, Prendick,""
159	said he, in a far more familiar tone than before.  I made no ado,
159	but set to work on the biscuits at once, while the white-haired man
159	helped Montgomery to release about a score more of the rabbits.
159	Three big hutches, however, went up to the house with the puma.
159	The brandy I did not touch, for I have been an abstainer from
159	my birth.
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	VII.  THE LOCKED DOOR.
159	
159	
159	THE reader will perhaps understand that at first everything was so strange
159	about me, and my position was the outcome of such unexpected adventures,
159	that I had no discernment of the relative strangeness of this
159	or that thing.  I followed the llama up the beach, and was overtaken
159	by Montgomery, who asked me not to enter the stone enclosure.
159	I noticed then that the puma in its cage and the pile of packages
159	had been placed outside the entrance to this quadrangle.
159	
159	I turned and saw that the launch had now been unloaded, run out again,
159	and was being beached, and the white-haired man was walking towards us.
159	He addressed Montgomery.
159	
159	""And now comes the problem of this uninvited guest.  What are we
159	to do with him?""
159	
159	""He knows something of science,"" said Montgomery.
159	
159	""I'm itching to get to work again--with this new stuff,""
159	said the white-haired man, nodding towards the enclosure.
159	His eyes grew brighter.
159	
159	""I daresay you are,"" said Montgomery, in anything but a cordial tone.
159	
159	""We can't send him over there, and we can't spare the time to build
159	him a new shanty; and we certainly can't take him into our confidence
159	just yet.""
159	
159	""I'm in your hands,"" said I. I had no idea of what he meant
159	by ""over there.""
159	
159	""I've been thinking of the same things,"" Montgomery answered.
159	""There's my room with the outer door--""
159	
159	""That's it,"" said the elder man, promptly, looking at Montgomery;
159	and all three of us went towards the enclosure.  ""I'm sorry to make
159	a mystery, Mr. Prendick; but you'll remember you're uninvited.
159	Our little establishment here contains a secret or so, is a kind
159	of Blue-Beard's chamber, in fact.  Nothing very dreadful, really, to a
159	sane man; but just now, as we don't know you--""
159	
159	""Decidedly,"" said I, ""I should be a fool to take offence at any want
159	of confidence.""
159	
159	He twisted his heavy mouth into a faint smile--he was one of those
159	saturnine people who smile with the corners of the mouth down,--and
159	bowed his acknowledgment of my complaisance.  The main entrance
159	to the enclosure was passed; it was a heavy wooden gate, framed in iron
159	and locked, with the cargo of the launch piled outside it, and at
159	the corner we came to a small doorway I had not previously observed.
159	The white-haired man produced a bundle of keys from the pocket
159	of his greasy blue jacket, opened this door, and entered.
159	His keys, and the elaborate locking-up of the place even while it
159	was still under his eye, struck me as peculiar.  I followed him,
159	and found myself in a small apartment, plainly but not uncomfortably
159	furnished and with its inner door, which was slightly ajar, opening into
159	a paved courtyard.  This inner door Montgomery at once closed.
159	A hammock was slung across the darker corner of the room, and a
159	small unglazed window defended by an iron bar looked out towards
159	the sea.
159	
159	This the white-haired man told me was to be my apartment;
159	and the inner door, which ""for fear of accidents,"" he said,
159	he would lock on the other side, was my limit inward.
159	He called my attention to a convenient deck-chair before the window,
159	and to an array of old books, chiefly, I found, surgical works
159	and editions of the Latin and Greek classics (languages I
159	cannot read with any comfort), on a shelf near the hammock.
159	He left the room by the outer door, as if to avoid opening the inner
159	one again.
159	
159	""We usually have our meals in here,"" said Montgomery, and then,
159	as if in doubt, went out after the other.  ""Moreau!"" I heard
159	him call, and for the moment I do not think I noticed.
159	Then as I handled the books on the shelf it came up in consciousness:
159	Where had I heard the name of Moreau before?  I sat down before
159	the window, took out the biscuits that still remained to me,
159	and ate them with an excellent appetite.  Moreau!
159	
159	Through the window I saw one of those unaccountable men in white, lugging a
159	packing-case along the beach.  Presently the window-frame hid him.
159	Then I heard a key inserted and turned in the lock behind me.
159	After a little while I heard through the locked door the noise
159	of the staghounds, that had now been brought up from the beach.
159	They were not barking, but sniffing and growling in a curious fashion.
159	I could hear the rapid patter of their feet, and Montgomery's voice
159	soothing them.
159	
159	I was very much impressed by the elaborate secrecy of these two men
159	regarding the contents of the place, and for some time I was thinking
159	of that and of the unaccountable familiarity of the name of Moreau;
159	but so odd is the human memory that I could not then recall that
159	well-known name in its proper connection.  From that my thoughts
159	went to the indefinable queerness of the deformed man on the beach.
159	I never saw such a gait, such odd motions as he pulled at the box.
159	I recalled that none of these men had spoken to me, though most
159	of them I had found looking at me at one time or another in a
159	peculiarly furtive manner, quite unlike the frank stare of your
159	unsophisticated savage.  Indeed, they had all seemed remarkably taciturn,
159	and when they did speak, endowed with very uncanny voices.
159	What was wrong with them?  Then I recalled the eyes of Montgomery's
159	ungainly attendant.
159	
159	Just as I was thinking of him he came in.  He was now dressed in white,
159	and carried a little tray with some coffee and boiled vegetables thereon.
159	I could hardly repress a shuddering recoil as he came, bending amiably,
159	and placed the tray before me on the table.  Then astonishment
159	paralysed me.  Under his stringy black locks I saw his ear;
159	it jumped upon me suddenly close to my face.  The man had pointed ears,
159	covered with a fine brown fur!
159	
159	""Your breakfast, sair,"" he said.
159	
159	I stared at his face without attempting to answer him.  He turned
159	and went towards the door, regarding me oddly over his shoulder.
159	I followed him out with my eyes; and as I did so, by some odd trick
159	of unconscious cerebration, there came surging into my head the phrase,
159	""The Moreau Hollows""--was it?  ""The Moreau--"" Ah!  It sent my memory
159	back ten years.  ""The Moreau Horrors!""  The phrase drifted loose
159	in my mind for a moment, and then I saw it in red lettering on a little
159	buff-coloured pamphlet, to read which made one shiver and creep.
159	Then I remembered distinctly all about it.  That long-forgotten
159	pamphlet came back with startling vividness to my mind.
159	I had been a mere lad then, and Moreau was, I suppose, about fifty,--a
159	prominent and masterful physiologist, well-known in scientific
159	circles for his extraordinary imagination and his brutal directness
159	in discussion.
159	
159	Was this the same Moreau?  He had published some very astonishing
159	facts in connection with the transfusion of blood, and in
159	addition was known to be doing valuable work on morbid growths.
159	Then suddenly his career was closed.  He had to leave England.
159	A journalist obtained access to his laboratory in the capacity
159	of laboratory-assistant, with the deliberate intention of making
159	sensational exposures; and by the help of a shocking accident
159	(if it was an accident), his gruesome pamphlet became notorious.
159	On the day of its publication a wretched dog, flayed and
159	otherwise mutilated, escaped from Moreau's house.  It was in
159	the silly season, and a prominent editor, a cousin of the temporary
159	laboratory-assistant, appealed to the conscience of the nation.
159	It was not the first time that conscience has turned against the methods
159	of research.  The doctor was simply howled out of the country.
159	It may be that he deserved to be; but I still think that the tepid
159	support of his fellow-investigators and his desertion by the great
159	body of scientific workers was a shameful thing.  Yet some of
159	his experiments, by the journalist's account, were wantonly cruel.
159	He might perhaps have purchased his social peace by abandoning
159	his investigations; but he apparently preferred the latter, as most men
159	would who have once fallen under the overmastering spell of research.
159	He was unmarried, and had indeed nothing but his own interest
159	to consider.
159	
159	I felt convinced that this must be the same man.  Everything pointed
159	to it.  It dawned upon me to what end the puma and the other
159	animals--which had now been brought with other luggage into the
159	enclosure behind the house--were destined; and a curious faint odour,
159	the halitus of something familiar, an odour that had been in
159	the background of my consciousness hitherto, suddenly came forward
159	into the forefront of my thoughts.  It was the antiseptic odour
159	of the dissecting-room. I heard the puma growling through the wall,
159	and one of the dogs yelped as though it had been struck.
159	
159	Yet surely, and especially to another scientific man, there was
159	nothing so horrible in vivisection as to account for this secrecy;
159	and by some odd leap in my thoughts the pointed ears and luminous
159	eyes of Montgomery's attendant came back again before me with
159	the sharpest definition.  I stared before me out at the green sea,
159	frothing under a freshening breeze, and let these and other strange
159	memories of the last few days chase one another through my mind.
159	
159	What could it all mean?  A locked enclosure on a lonely island,
159	a notorious vivisector, and these crippled and distorted men?
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	VIII.  THE CRYING OF THE PUMA.
159	
159	
159	MONTGOMERY interrupted my tangle of mystification and suspicion
159	about one o'clock, and his grotesque attendant followed him
159	with a tray bearing bread, some herbs and other eatables,
159	a flask of whiskey, a jug of water, and three glasses and knives.
159	I glanced askance at this strange creature, and found him watching
159	me with his queer, restless eyes.  Montgomery said he would lunch
159	with me, but that Moreau was too preoccupied with some work
159	to come.
159	
159	""Moreau!"" said I.  ""I know that name.""
159	
159	""The devil you do!"" said he.  ""What an ass I was to mention it to you!
159	I might have thought.  Anyhow, it will give you an inkling
159	of our--mysteries.  Whiskey?""
159	
159	""No, thanks; I'm an abstainer.""
159	
159	""I wish I'd been.  But it's no use locking the door
159	after the steed is stolen.  It was that infernal
159	stuff which led to my coming here,--that, and a foggy night.
159	I thought myself in luck at the time, when Moreau offered to get me off.
159	It's queer--""
159	
159	""Montgomery,"" said I, suddenly, as the outer door closed, ""why has
159	your man pointed ears?""
159	
159	""Damn!"" he said, over his first mouthful of food.  He stared at me
159	for a moment, and then repeated, ""Pointed ears?""
159	
159	""Little points to them,"" said I, as calmly as possible, with a catch
159	in my breath; ""and a fine black fur at the edges?""
159	
159	He helped himself to whiskey and water with great deliberation.
159	""I was under the impression--that his hair covered his ears.""
159	
159	""I saw them as he stooped by me to put that coffee you sent to me
159	on the table.  And his eyes shine in the dark.""
159	
159	By this time Montgomery had recovered from the surprise of my question.
159	""I always thought,"" he said deliberately, with a certain
159	accentuation of his flavouring of lisp, ""that there _was_ something
159	the matter with his ears, from the way he covered them.
159	What were they like?""
159	
159	I was persuaded from his manner that this ignorance was a pretence.
159	Still, I could hardly tell the man that I thought him a liar.
159	""Pointed,"" I said; ""rather small and furry,--distinctly furry.
159	But the whole man is one of the strangest beings I ever set
159	eyes on.""
159	
159	A sharp, hoarse cry of animal pain came from the enclosure behind us.
159	Its depth and volume testified to the puma.  I saw Montgomery wince.
159	
159	""Yes?"" he said.
159	
159	""Where did you pick up the creature?""
159	
159	""San Francisco.  He's an ugly brute, I admit.  Half-witted, you know.
159	Can't remember where he came from.  But I'm used to him, you know.
159	We both are.  How does he strike you?""
159	
159	""He's unnatural,"" I said.  ""There's something about him--don't
159	think me fanciful, but it gives me a nasty little sensation,
159	a tightening of my muscles, when he comes near me.  It's a touch--of
159	the diabolical, in fact.""
159	
159	Montgomery had stopped eating while I told him this.  ""Rum!"" he said.
159	""I can't see it.""  He resumed his meal.  ""I had no idea of it,""
159	he said, and masticated.  ""The crew of the schooner must have
159	felt it the same.  Made a dead set at the poor devil.  You saw
159	the captain?""
159	
159	Suddenly the puma howled again, this time more painfully.
159	Montgomery swore under his breath.  I had half a mind to attack him
159	about the men on the beach.  Then the poor brute within gave vent
159	to a series of short, sharp cries.
159	
159	""Your men on the beach,"" said I; ""what race are they?""
159	
159	""Excellent fellows, aren't they?"" said he, absentmindedly,
159	knitting his brows as the animal yelled out sharply.
159	
159	I said no more.  There was another outcry worse than the former.
159	He looked at me with his dull grey eyes, and then took some
159	more whiskey.  He tried to draw me into a discussion about alcohol,
159	professing to have saved my life with it.  He seemed anxious
159	to lay stress on the fact that I owed my life to him.  I answered
159	him distractedly.
159	
159	Presently our meal came to an end; the misshapen monster with
159	the pointed ears cleared the remains away, and Montgomery left
159	me alone in the room again.  All the time he had been in a state
159	of ill-concealed irritation at the noise of the vivisected puma.
159	He had spoken of his odd want of nerve, and left me to the
159	obvious application.
159	
159	I found myself that the cries were singularly irritating,
159	and they grew in depth and intensity as the afternoon wore on.
159	They were painful at first, but their constant resurgence at last
159	altogether upset my balance.  I flung aside a crib of Horace I
159	had been reading, and began to clench my fists, to bite my lips,
159	and to pace the room.  Presently I got to stopping my ears with
159	my fingers.
159	
159	The emotional appeal of those yells grew upon me steadily,
159	grew at last to such an exquisite expression of suffering that I
159	could stand it in that confined room no longer.  I stepped
159	out of the door into the slumberous heat of the late afternoon,
159	and walking past the main entrance--locked again, I noticed--turned
159	the corner of the wall.
159	
159	The crying sounded even louder out of doors.  It was as if all the pain
159	in the world had found a voice.  Yet had I known such pain was in
159	the next room, and had it been dumb, I believe--I have thought since--I
159	could have stood it well enough.  It is when suffering finds a voice
159	and sets our nerves quivering that this pity comes troubling us.
159	But in spite of the brilliant sunlight and the green fans of the trees
159	waving in the soothing sea-breeze, the world was a confusion,
159	blurred with drifting black and red phantasms, until I was out of earshot
159	of the house in the chequered wall.
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	IX.  THE THING IN THE FOREST.
159	
159	
159	I STRODE through the undergrowth that clothed the ridge behind the house,
159	scarcely heeding whither I went; passed on through the shadow of a thick
159	cluster of straight-stemmed trees beyond it, and so presently found
159	myself some way on the other side of the ridge, and descending towards
159	a streamlet that ran through a narrow valley.  I paused and listened.
159	The distance I had come, or the intervening masses of thicket,
159	deadened any sound that might be coming from the enclosure.
159	The air was still.  Then with a rustle a rabbit emerged, and went
159	scampering up the slope before me.  I hesitated, and sat down in the edge
159	of the shade.
159	
159	The place was a pleasant one.  The rivulet was hidden
159	by the luxuriant vegetation of the banks save at one point,
159	where I caught a triangular patch of its glittering water.
159	On the farther side I saw through a bluish haze a tangle of trees
159	and creepers, and above these again the luminous blue of the sky.
159	Here and there a splash of white or crimson marked the blooming of some
159	trailing epiphyte.  I let my eyes wander over this scene for a while,
159	and then began to turn over in my mind again the strange peculiarities
159	of Montgomery's man.  But it was too hot to think elaborately,
159	and presently I fell into a tranquil state midway between dozing
159	and waking.
159	
159	From this I was aroused, after I know not how long, by a
159	rustling amidst the greenery on the other side of the stream.
159	For a moment I could see nothing but the waving summits of
159	the ferns and reeds.  Then suddenly upon the bank of the stream
159	appeared something--at first I could not distinguish what it was.
159	It bowed its round head to the water, and began to drink.
159	Then I saw it was a man, going on all-fours like a beast.  He was clothed
159	in bluish cloth, and was of a copper-coloured hue, with black hair.
159	It seemed that grotesque ugliness was an invariable character of
159	these islanders.  I could hear the suck of the water at his lips as
159	he drank.
159	
159	I leant forward to see him better, and a piece of lava, detached by
159	my hand, went pattering down the slope.  He looked up guiltily,
159	and his eyes met mine.  Forthwith he scrambled to his feet,
159	and stood wiping his clumsy hand across his mouth and regarding me.
159	His legs were scarcely half the length of his body.
159	So, staring one another out of countenance, we remained for perhaps
159	the space of a minute.  Then, stopping to look back once or twice,
159	he slunk off among the bushes to the right of me, and I heard
159	the swish of the fronds grow faint in the distance and die away.
159	Long after he had disappeared, I remained sitting up staring
159	in the direction of his retreat.  My drowsy tranquillity
159	had gone.
159	
159	I was startled by a noise behind me, and turning suddenly saw
159	the flapping white tail of a rabbit vanishing up the slope.
159	I jumped to my feet.  The apparition of this grotesque, half-bestial
159	creature had suddenly populated the stillness of the afternoon for me.
159	I looked around me rather nervously, and regretted that I was unarmed.
159	Then I thought that the man I had just seen had been clothed
159	in bluish cloth, had not been naked as a savage would have been;
159	and I tried to persuade myself from that fact that he was after all
159	probably a peaceful character, that the dull ferocity of his countenance
159	belied him.
159	
159	Yet I was greatly disturbed at the apparition.  I walked
159	to the left along the slope, turning my head about and peering
159	this way and that among the straight stems of the trees.
159	Why should a man go on all-fours and drink with his lips?  Presently I
159	heard an animal wailing again, and taking it to be the puma, I turned
159	about and walked in a direction diametrically opposite to the sound.
159	This led me down to the stream, across which I stepped and pushed
159	my way up through the undergrowth beyond.
159	
159	I was startled by a great patch of vivid scarlet on the ground,
159	and going up to it found it to be a peculiar fungus, branched and
159	corrugated like a foliaceous lichen, but deliquescing into slime
159	at the touch; and then in the shadow of some luxuriant ferns I
159	came upon an unpleasant thing,--the dead body of a rabbit covered
159	with shining flies, but still warm and with the head torn off.
159	I stopped aghast at the sight of the scattered blood.
159	Here at least was one visitor to the island disposed of!
159	There were no traces of other violence about it.  It looked as though it
159	had been suddenly snatched up and killed; and as I stared at the little
159	furry body came the difficulty of how the thing had been done.
159	The vague dread that had been in my mind since I had seen the inhuman
159	face of the man at the stream grew distincter as I stood there.
159	I began to realise the hardihood of my expedition among these
159	unknown people.  The thicket about me became altered to my imagination.
159	Every shadow became something more than a shadow,--became an ambush;
159	every rustle became a threat.  Invisible things seemed watching me.
159	I resolved to go back to the enclosure on the beach.  I suddenly
159	turned away and thrust myself violently, possibly even frantically,
159	through the bushes, anxious to get a clear space about me
159	again.
159	
159	I stopped just in time to prevent myself emerging upon an open space.
159	It was a kind of glade in the forest, made by a fall; seedlings were
159	already starting up to struggle for the vacant space; and beyond,
159	the dense growth of stems and twining vines and splashes of fungus
159	and flowers closed in again.  Before me, squatting together upon
159	the fungoid ruins of a huge fallen tree and still unaware of my approach,
159	were three grotesque human figures.  One was evidently a female;
159	the other two were men.  They were naked, save for swathings
159	of scarlet cloth about the middle; and their skins were of a dull
159	pinkish-drab colour, such as I had seen in no savages before.
159	They had fat, heavy, chinless faces, retreating foreheads,
159	and a scant bristly hair upon their heads.  I never saw such
159	bestial-looking creatures.
159	
159	They were talking, or at least one of the men was talking to the other two,
159	and all three had been too closely interested to heed the rustling of
159	my approach.  They swayed their heads and shoulders from side to side.
159	The speaker's words came thick and sloppy, and though I could
159	hear them distinctly I could not distinguish what he said.
159	He seemed to me to be reciting some complicated gibberish.
159	Presently his articulation became shriller, and spreading his hands
159	he rose to his feet.  At that the others began to gibber in unison,
159	also rising to their feet, spreading their hands and swaying their
159	bodies in rhythm with their chant.  I noticed then the abnormal
159	shortness of their legs, and their lank, clumsy feet.  All three began
159	slowly to circle round, raising and stamping their feet and waving
159	their arms; a kind of tune crept into their rhythmic recitation,
159	and a refrain,--""Aloola,"" or ""Balloola,"" it sounded like.
159	Their eyes began to sparkle, and their ugly faces to brighten,
159	with an expression of strange pleasure.  Saliva dripped from their
159	lipless mouths.
159	
159	Suddenly, as I watched their grotesque and unaccountable gestures,
159	I perceived clearly for the first time what it was that had offended me,
159	what had given me the two inconsistent and conflicting impressions
159	of utter strangeness and yet of the strangest familiarity.
159	The three creatures engaged in this mysterious rite were human in shape,
159	and yet human beings with the strangest air about them of some
159	familiar animal.  Each of these creatures, despite its human form,
159	its rag of clothing, and the rough humanity of its bodily form,
159	had woven into it--into its movements, into the expression of
159	its countenance, into its whole presence--some now irresistible
159	suggestion of a hog, a swinish taint, the unmistakable mark of
159	the beast.
159	
159	I stood overcome by this amazing realisation and then the most horrible
159	questionings came rushing into my mind.  They began leaping in the air,
159	first one and then the other, whooping and grunting.  Then one slipped,
159	and for a moment was on all-fours,--to recover, indeed, forthwith.
159	But that transitory gleam of the true animalism of these monsters
159	was enough.
159	
159	I turned as noiselessly as possible, and becoming every now
159	and then rigid with the fear of being discovered, as a branch
159	cracked or a leaf rustled, I pushed back into the bushes.
159	It was long before I grew bolder, and dared to move freely.
159	My only idea for the moment was to get away from these foul beings, and I
159	scarcely noticed that I had emerged upon a faint pathway amidst the trees.
159	Then suddenly traversing a little glade, I saw with an unpleasant start
159	two clumsy legs among the trees, walking with noiseless footsteps
159	parallel with my course, and perhaps thirty yards away from me.
159	The head and upper part of the body were hidden by a tangle of creeper.
159	I stopped abruptly, hoping the creature did not see me.
159	The feet stopped as I did.  So nervous was I that I controlled
159	an impulse to headlong flight with the utmost difficulty.
159	Then looking hard, I distinguished through the interlacing network
159	the head and body of the brute I had seen drinking.  He moved his head.
159	There was an emerald flash in his eyes as he glanced at me from
159	the shadow of the trees, a half-luminous colour that vanished as
159	he turned his head again.  He was motionless for a moment, and then
159	with a noiseless tread began running through the green confusion.
159	In another moment he had vanished behind some bushes.
159	I could not see him, but I felt that he had stopped and was watching me
159	again.
159	
159	What on earth was he,--man or beast?  What did he want with me?
159	I had no weapon, not even a stick.  Flight would be madness.
159	At any rate the Thing, whatever it was, lacked the courage to attack me.
159	Setting my teeth hard, I walked straight towards him.
159	I was anxious not to show the fear that seemed chilling my backbone.
159	I pushed through a tangle of tall white-flowered bushes,
159	and saw him twenty paces beyond, looking over his shoulder at me
159	and hesitating.  I advanced a step or two, looking steadfastly into
159	his eyes.
159	
159	""Who are you?"" said I.
159	
159	He tried to meet my gaze.  ""No!"" he said suddenly, and turning went
159	bounding away from me through the undergrowth.  Then he turned
159	and stared at me again.  His eyes shone brightly out of the dusk
159	under the trees.
159	
159	My heart was in my mouth; but I felt my only chance was bluff,
159	and walked steadily towards him.  He turned again, and vanished
159	into the dusk.  Once more I thought I caught the glint of his eyes,
159	and that was all.
159	
159	For the first time I realised how the lateness of the hour
159	might affect me.  The sun had set some minutes since, the swift
159	dusk of the tropics was already fading out of the eastern sky,
159	and a pioneer moth fluttered silently by my head.  Unless I would
159	spend the night among the unknown dangers of the mysterious forest,
159	I must hasten back to the enclosure.  The thought of a return
159	to that pain-haunted refuge was extremely disagreeable, but still
159	more so was the idea of being overtaken in the open by darkness
159	and all that darkness might conceal.  I gave one more look
159	into the blue shadows that had swallowed up this odd creature,
159	and then retraced my way down the slope towards the stream,
159	going as I judged in the direction from which I had come.
159	
159	I walked eagerly, my mind confused with many things,
159	and presently found myself in a level place among scattered trees.
159	The colourless clearness that comes after the sunset flush
159	was darkling; the blue sky above grew momentarily deeper,
159	and the little stars one by one pierced the attenuated light;
159	the interspaces of the trees, the gaps in the further vegetation,
159	that had been hazy blue in the daylight, grew black and mysterious.
159	I pushed on.  The colour vanished from the world.
159	The tree-tops rose against the luminous blue sky in inky silhouette,
159	and all below that outline melted into one formless blackness.
159	Presently the trees grew thinner, and the shrubby undergrowth
159	more abundant.  Then there was a desolate space covered with
159	a white sand, and then another expanse of tangled bushes.
159	I did not remember crossing the sand-opening before.
159	I began to be tormented by a faint rustling upon my right hand.
159	I thought at first it was fancy, for whenever I stopped there
159	was silence, save for the evening breeze in the tree-tops.
159	Then when I turned to hurry on again there was an echo to
159	my footsteps.
159	
159	I turned away from the thickets, keeping to the more open ground,
159	and endeavouring by sudden turns now and then to surprise something
159	in the act of creeping upon me.  I saw nothing, and nevertheless
159	my sense of another presence grew steadily.  I increased my pace,
159	and after some time came to a slight ridge, crossed it, and turned sharply,
159	regarding it steadfastly from the further side.  It came out black
159	and clear-cut against the darkling sky; and presently a shapeless
159	lump heaved up momentarily against the sky-line and vanished again.
159	I felt assured now that my tawny-faced antagonist was stalking me
159	once more; and coupled with that was another unpleasant realisation,
159	that I had lost my way.
159	
159	For a time I hurried on hopelessly perplexed, and pursued by that
159	stealthy approach.  Whatever it was, the Thing either lacked the courage
159	to attack me, or it was waiting to take me at some disadvantage.
159	I kept studiously to the open.  At times I would turn and listen;
159	and presently I had half persuaded myself that my pursuer had abandoned
159	the chase, or was a mere creation of my disordered imagination.
159	Then I heard the sound of the sea.  I quickened my footsteps
159	almost into a run, and immediately there was a stumble in
159	my rear.
159	
159	I turned suddenly, and stared at the uncertain trees behind me.
159	One black shadow seemed to leap into another.  I listened,
159	rigid, and heard nothing but the creep of the blood in my ears.
159	I thought that my nerves were unstrung, and that my imagination
159	was tricking me, and turned resolutely towards the sound of the
159	sea again.
159	
159	In a minute or so the trees grew thinner, and I emerged upon
159	a bare, low headland running out into the sombre water.
159	The night was calm and clear, and the reflection of the growing
159	multitude of the stars shivered in the tranquil heaving of the sea.
159	Some way out, the wash upon an irregular band of reef shone
159	with a pallid light of its own.  Westward I saw the zodiacal
159	light mingling with the yellow brilliance of the evening star.
159	The coast fell away from me to the east, and westward it was hidden
159	by the shoulder of the cape.  Then I recalled the fact that Moreau's
159	beach lay to the west.
159	
159	A twig snapped behind me, and there was a rustle.  I turned, and stood
159	facing the dark trees.  I could see nothing--or else I could see too much.
159	Every dark form in the dimness had its ominous quality, its peculiar
159	suggestion of alert watchfulness.  So I stood for perhaps a minute,
159	and then, with an eye to the trees still, turned westward to cross
159	the headland; and as I moved, one among the lurking shadows moved
159	to follow me.
159	
159	My heart beat quickly.  Presently the broad sweep of a bay
159	to the westward became visible, and I halted again.
159	The noiseless shadow halted a dozen yards from me.
159	A little point of light shone on the further bend of the curve,
159	and the grey sweep of the sandy beach lay faint under the starlight.
159	Perhaps two miles away was that little point of light.
159	To get to the beach I should have to go through the trees where the
159	shadows lurked, and down a bushy slope.
159	
159	I could see the Thing rather more distinctly now.  It was no animal,
159	for it stood erect.  At that I opened my mouth to speak, and found
159	a hoarse phlegm choked my voice.  I tried again, and shouted,
159	""Who is there?""  There was no answer.  I advanced a step.
159	The Thing did not move, only gathered itself together.  My foot
159	struck a stone.  That gave me an idea.  Without taking my eyes off
159	the black form before me, I stooped and picked up this lump of rock;
159	but at my motion the Thing turned abruptly as a dog might have done,
159	and slunk obliquely into the further darkness.  Then I recalled
159	a schoolboy expedient against big dogs, and twisted the rock into
159	my handkerchief, and gave this a turn round my wrist.  I heard a movement
159	further off among the shadows, as if the Thing was in retreat.
159	Then suddenly my tense excitement gave way; I broke into a profuse
159	perspiration and fell a-trembling, with my adversary routed and this
159	weapon in my hand.
159	
159	It was some time before I could summon resolution to go down through
159	the trees and bushes upon the flank of the headland to the beach.
159	At last I did it at a run; and as I emerged from the thicket
159	upon the sand, I heard some other body come crashing after me.
159	At that I completely lost my head with fear, and began running
159	along the sand.  Forthwith there came the swift patter of soft
159	feet in pursuit.  I gave a wild cry, and redoubled my pace.
159	Some dim, black things about three or four times the size of rabbits
159	went running or hopping up from the beach towards the bushes as
159	I passed.
159	
159	So long as I live, I shall remember the terror of that chase.
159	I ran near the water's edge, and heard every now and then the splash
159	of the feet that gained upon me.  Far away, hopelessly far,
159	was the yellow light.  All the night about us was black and still.
159	Splash, splash, came the pursuing feet, nearer and nearer.
159	I felt my breath going, for I was quite out of training; it whooped
159	as I drew it, and I felt a pain like a knife at my side.  I perceived
159	the Thing would come up with me long before I reached the enclosure,
159	and, desperate and sobbing for my breath, I wheeled round upon it
159	and struck at it as it came up to me,--struck with all my strength.
159	The stone came out of the sling of the handkerchief as I did so.
159	As I turned, the Thing, which had been running on all-fours,
159	rose to its feet, and the missile fell fair on its left temple.
159	The skull rang loud, and the animal-man blundered into me,
159	thrust me back with its hands, and went staggering past me to fall
159	headlong upon the sand with its face in the water; and there it lay
159	still.
159	
159	I could not bring myself to approach that black heap.  I left
159	it there, with the water rippling round it, under the still stars,
159	and giving it a wide berth pursued my way towards the yellow glow
159	of the house; and presently, with a positive effect of relief,
159	came the pitiful moaning of the puma, the sound that had
159	originally driven me out to explore this mysterious island.
159	At that, though I was faint and horribly fatigued, I gathered
159	together all my strength, and began running again towards the light.
159	I thought I heard a voice calling me.
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	X.  THE CRYING OF THE MAN.
159	
159	
159	AS I drew near the house I saw that the light shone from
159	the open door of my room; and then I heard coming from out
159	of the darkness at the side of that orange oblong of light,
159	the voice of Montgomery shouting, ""Prendick!""  I continued running.
159	Presently I heard him again.  I replied by a feeble ""Hullo!""
159	and in another moment had staggered up to him.
159	
159	""Where have you been?"" said he, holding me at arm's length,
159	so that the light from the door fell on my face.  ""We have both
159	been so busy that we forgot you until about half an hour ago.""
159	He led me into the room and sat me down in the deck chair.
159	For awhile I was blinded by the light.  ""We did not think you would start
159	to explore this island of ours without telling us,"" he said; and then,
159	""I was afraid--But--what--Hullo!""
159	
159	My last remaining strength slipped from me, and my head fell forward
159	on my chest.  I think he found a certain satisfaction in giving
159	me brandy.
159	
159	""For God's sake,"" said I, ""fasten that door.""
159	
159	""You've been meeting some of our curiosities, eh?"" said he.
159	
159	He locked the door and turned to me again.  He asked me no questions,
159	but gave me some more brandy and water and pressed me to eat.
159	I was in a state of collapse.  He said something vague about his
159	forgetting to warn me, and asked me briefly when I left the house
159	and what I had seen.
159	
159	I answered him as briefly, in fragmentary sentences.  ""Tell me
159	what it all means,"" said I, in a state bordering on hysterics.
159	
159	""It's nothing so very dreadful,"" said he.  ""But I think you
159	have had about enough for one day.""  The puma suddenly gave
159	a sharp yell of pain.  At that he swore under his breath.
159	""I'm damned,"" said he, ""if this place is not as bad as Gower Street,
159	with its cats.""
159	
159	""Montgomery,"" said I, ""what was that thing that came after me?
159	Was it a beast or was it a man?""
159	
159	""If you don't sleep to-night,"" he said, ""you'll be off your
159	head to-morrow.""
159	
159	I stood up in front of him.  ""What was that thing that came after me?""
159	I asked.
159	
159	He looked me squarely in the eyes, and twisted his mouth askew.
159	His eyes, which had seemed animated a minute before, went dull.
159	""From your account,"" said he, ""I'm thinking it was a bogle.""
159	
159	I felt a gust of intense irritation, which passed as quickly as it came.
159	I flung myself into the chair again, and pressed my hands on my forehead.
159	The puma began once more.
159	
159	Montgomery came round behind me and put his hand on my shoulder.
159	""Look here, Prendick,"" he said, ""I had no business to let
159	you drift out into this silly island of ours.  But it's not
159	so bad as you feel, man.  Your nerves are worked to rags.
159	Let me give you something that will make you sleep.  _That_--will keep
159	on for hours yet.  You must simply get to sleep, or I won't answer
159	for it.""
159	
159	I did not reply.  I bowed forward, and covered my face with my hands.
159	Presently he returned with a small measure containing a dark liquid.
159	This he gave me.  I took it unresistingly, and he helped me into
159	the hammock.
159	
159	When I awoke, it was broad day.  For a little while I lay flat,
159	staring at the roof above me.  The rafters, I observed, were made
159	out of the timbers of a ship.  Then I turned my head, and saw a meal
159	prepared for me on the table.  I perceived that I was hungry,
159	and prepared to clamber out of the hammock, which, very politely
159	anticipating my intention, twisted round and deposited me upon
159	all-fours on the floor.
159	
159	I got up and sat down before the food.  I had a heavy feeling
159	in my head, and only the vaguest memory at first of the things
159	that had happened over night.  The morning breeze blew very
159	pleasantly through the unglazed window, and that and the food
159	contributed to the sense of animal comfort which I experienced.
159	Presently the door behind me--the door inward towards the yard
159	of the enclosure--opened.  I turned and saw Montgomery's face.
159	
159	""All right,"" said he.  ""I'm frightfully busy.""  And he shut the door.
159	
159	Afterwards I discovered that he forgot to re-lock it.
159	Then I recalled the expression of his face the previous night,
159	and with that the memory of all I had experienced reconstructed
159	itself before me.  Even as that fear came back to me came a cry
159	from within; but this time it was not the cry of a puma.
159	I put down the mouthful that hesitated upon my lips, and listened.
159	Silence, save for the whisper of the morning breeze.  I began to think my
159	ears had deceived me.
159	
159	After a long pause I resumed my meal, but with my ears still vigilant.
159	Presently I heard something else, very faint and low.
159	I sat as if frozen in my attitude.  Though it was faint and low,
159	it moved me more profoundly than all that I had hitherto heard of
159	the abominations behind the wall.  There was no mistake this time in
159	the quality of the dim, broken sounds; no doubt at all of their source.
159	For it was groaning, broken by sobs and gasps of anguish.
159	It was no brute this time; it was a human being in torment!
159	
159	As I realised this I rose, and in three steps had crossed the room,
159	seized the handle of the door into the yard, and flung it open
159	before me.
159	
159	""Prendick, man!  Stop!"" cried Montgomery, intervening.
159	
159	A startled deerhound yelped and snarled.  There was blood, I saw,
159	in the sink,--brown, and some scarlet--and I smelt the peculiar
159	smell of carbolic acid.  Then through an open doorway beyond,
159	in the dim light of the shadow, I saw something bound painfully
159	upon a framework, scarred, red, and bandaged; and then blotting
159	this out appeared the face of old Moreau, white and terrible.
159	In a moment he had gripped me by the shoulder with a hand that was
159	smeared red, had twisted me off my feet, and flung me headlong back
159	into my own room.  He lifted me as though I was a little child.
159	I fell at full length upon the floor, and the door slammed
159	and shut out the passionate intensity of his face.
159	Then I heard the key turn in the lock, and Montgomery's voice
159	in expostulation.
159	
159	""Ruin the work of a lifetime,"" I heard Moreau say.
159	
159	""He does not understand,"" said Montgomery.  and other things
159	that were inaudible.
159	
159	""I can't spare the time yet,"" said Moreau.
159	
159	The rest I did not hear.  I picked myself up and stood trembling,
159	my mind a chaos of the most horrible misgivings.  Could it be possible,
159	I thought, that such a thing as the vivisection of men was carried
159	on here?  The question shot like lightning across a tumultuous sky;
159	and suddenly the clouded horror of my mind condensed into a vivid
159	realisation of my own danger.
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	XI.  THE HUNTING OF THE MAN.
159	
159	
159	IT came before my mind with an unreasonable hope of escape that
159	the outer door of my room was still open to me.  I was convinced now,
159	absolutely assured, that Moreau had been vivisecting a human being.
159	All the time since I had heard his name, I had been trying to link
159	in my mind in some way the grotesque animalism of the islanders
159	with his abominations; and now I thought I saw it all.
159	The memory of his work on the transfusion of blood recurred to me.
159	These creatures I had seen were the victims of some hideous experiment.
159	These sickening scoundrels had merely intended to keep me back,
159	to fool me with their display of confidence, and presently to fall
159	upon me with a fate more horrible than death,--with torture;
159	and after torture the most hideous degradation it is possible
159	to conceive,--to send me off a lost soul, a beast, to the rest of their
159	Comus rout.
159	
159	I looked round for some weapon.  Nothing.  Then with an inspiration I
159	turned over the deck chair, put my foot on the side of it, and tore
159	away the side rail.  It happened that a nail came away with the wood,
159	and projecting, gave a touch of danger to an otherwise petty weapon.
159	I heard a step outside, and incontinently flung open the door and found
159	Montgomery within a yard of it.  He meant to lock the outer door!
159	I raised this nailed stick of mine and cut at his face;
159	but he sprang back.  I hesitated a moment, then turned and fled,
159	round the corner of the house.  ""Prendick, man!""  I heard his
159	astonished cry, ""don't be a silly ass, man!""
159	
159	Another minute, thought I, and he would have had me locked in,
159	and as ready as a hospital rabbit for my fate.  He emerged behind
159	the corner, for I heard him shout, ""Prendick!""  Then he began to run
159	after me, shouting things as he ran.  This time running blindly,
159	I went northeastward in a direction at right angles to my
159	previous expedition.  Once, as I went running headlong up the beach,
159	I glanced over my shoulder and saw his attendant with him.
159	I ran furiously up the slope, over it, then turning eastward along
159	a rocky valley fringed on either side with jungle I ran for perhaps
159	a mile altogether, my chest straining, my heart beating in my ears;
159	and then hearing nothing of Montgomery or his man, and feeling
159	upon the verge of exhaustion, I doubled sharply back towards
159	the beach as I judged, and lay down in the shelter of a canebrake.
159	There I remained for a long time, too fearful to move, and indeed
159	too fearful even to plan a course of action.  The wild scene about me
159	lay sleeping silently under the sun, and the only sound near me was
159	the thin hum of some small gnats that had discovered me.  Presently I
159	became aware of a drowsy breathing sound, the soughing of the sea upon
159	the beach.
159	
159	After about an hour I heard Montgomery shouting my name,
159	far away to the north.  That set me thinking of my plan of action.
159	As I interpreted it then, this island was inhabited only by these two
159	vivisectors and their animalised victims.  Some of these no doubt
159	they could press into their service against me if need arose.
159	I knew both Moreau and Montgomery carried revolvers; and, save for a feeble
159	bar of deal spiked with a small nail, the merest mockery of a mace,
159	I was unarmed.
159	
159	So I lay still there, until I began to think of food and drink;
159	and at that thought the real hopelessness of my position came home to me.
159	I knew no way of getting anything to eat.  I was too ignorant of botany
159	to discover any resort of root or fruit that might lie about me;
159	I had no means of trapping the few rabbits upon the island.
159	It grew blanker the more I turned the prospect over.  At last in
159	the desperation of my position, my mind turned to the animal men I
159	had encountered.  I tried to find some hope in what I remembered of them.
159	In turn I recalled each one I had seen, and tried to draw some augury
159	of assistance from my memory.
159	
159	Then suddenly I heard a staghound bay, and at that realised a new danger.
159	I took little time to think, or they would have caught me then,
159	but snatching up my nailed stick, rushed headlong from my hiding-place
159	towards the sound of the sea.  I remember a growth of thorny plants,
159	with spines that stabbed like pen-knives. I emerged bleeding and
159	with torn clothes upon the lip of a long creek opening northward.
159	I went straight into the water without a minute's hesitation, wading up
159	the creek, and presently finding myself kneedeep in a little stream.
159	I scrambled out at last on the westward bank, and with my heart beating
159	loudly in my ears, crept into a tangle of ferns to await the issue.
159	I heard the dog (there was only one) draw nearer, and yelp when it came
159	to the thorns.  Then I heard no more, and presently began to think I
159	had escaped.
159	
159	The minutes passed; the silence lengthened out, and at last
159	after an hour of security my courage began to return to me.
159	By this time I was no longer very much terrified or very miserable.
159	I had, as it were, passed the limit of terror and despair.
159	I felt now that my life was practically lost, and that persuasion
159	made me capable of daring anything.  I had even a certain wish
159	to encounter Moreau face to face; and as I had waded into the water,
159	I remembered that if I were too hard pressed at least one path
159	of escape from torment still lay open to me,--they could not
159	very well prevent my drowning myself.  I had half a mind to drown
159	myself then; but an odd wish to see the whole adventure out,
159	a queer, impersonal, spectacular interest in myself, restrained me.
159	I stretched my limbs, sore and painful from the pricks of the spiny plants,
159	and stared around me at the trees; and, so suddenly that it seemed
159	to jump out of the green tracery about it, my eyes lit upon a black
159	face watching me.  I saw that it was the simian creature who had
159	met the launch upon the beach.  He was clinging to the oblique
159	stem of a palm-tree. I gripped my stick, and stood up facing him.
159	He began chattering.  ""You, you, you,"" was all I could distinguish
159	at first.  Suddenly he dropped from the tree, and in another
159	moment was holding the fronds apart and staring curiously
159	at me.
159	
159	I did not feel the same repugnance towards this creature which I
159	had experienced in my encounters with the other Beast Men.
159	""You,"" he said, ""in the boat.""  He was a man, then,--at least as much
159	of a man as Montgomery's attendant,--for he could talk.
159	
159	""Yes,"" I said, ""I came in the boat.  From the ship.""
159	
159	""Oh!"" he said, and his bright, restless eyes travelled over me,
159	to my hands, to the stick I carried, to my feet, to the tattered places
159	in my coat, and the cuts and scratches I had received from the thorns.
159	He seemed puzzled at something.  His eyes came back to my hands.
159	He held his own hand out and counted his digits slowly, ""One, two,
159	three, four, five--eigh?""
159	
159	I did not grasp his meaning then; afterwards I was to find that
159	a great proportion of these Beast People had malformed hands,
159	lacking sometimes even three digits.  But guessing this was
159	in some way a greeting, I did the same thing by way of reply.
159	He grinned with immense satisfaction.  Then his swift roving
159	glance went round again; he made a swift movement--and vanished.
159	The fern fronds he had stood between came swishing together.
159	
159	I pushed out of the brake after him, and was astonished to find
159	him swinging cheerfully by one lank arm from a rope of creepers
159	that looped down from the foliage overhead.  His back was to me.
159	
159	""Hullo!"" said I.
159	
159	He came down with a twisting jump, and stood facing me.
159	
159	""I say,"" said I, ""where can I get something to eat?""
159	
159	""Eat!"" he said.  ""Eat Man's food, now.""  And his eye went back
159	to the swing of ropes.  ""At the huts.""
159	
159	""But where are the huts?""
159	
159	""Oh!""
159	
159	""I'm new, you know.""
159	
159	At that he swung round, and set off at a quick walk.
159	All his motions were curiously rapid.  ""Come along,"" said he.
159	
159	I went with him to see the adventure out.  I guessed the huts were some
159	rough shelter where he and some more of these Beast People lived.
159	I might perhaps find them friendly, find some handle in their minds
159	to take hold of.  I did not know how far they had forgotten their
159	human heritage.
159	
159	My ape-like companion trotted along by my side, with his hands
159	hanging down and his jaw thrust forward.  I wondered what memory
159	he might have in him.  ""How long have you been on this island?""
159	said I.
159	
159	""How long?"" he asked; and after having the question repeated,
159	he held up three fingers.
159	
159	The creature was little better than an idiot.  I tried
159	to make out what he meant by that, and it seems I bored him.
159	After another question or two he suddenly left my side and went
159	leaping at some fruit that hung from a tree.  He pulled down
159	a handful of prickly husks and went on eating the contents.
159	I noted this with satisfaction, for here at least was a hint for feeding.
159	I tried him with some other questions, but his chattering, prompt responses
159	were as often as not quite at cross purposes with my question.
159	Some few were appropriate, others quite parrot-like.
159	
159	I was so intent upon these peculiarities that I scarcely noticed the path
159	we followed.  Presently we came to trees, all charred and brown,
159	and so to a bare place covered with a yellow-white incrustation,
159	across which a drifting smoke, pungent in whiffs to nose and eyes,
159	went drifting.  On our right, over a shoulder of bare rock, I saw
159	the level blue of the sea.  The path coiled down abruptly into a narrow
159	ravine between two tumbled and knotty masses of blackish scoriae.
159	Into this we plunged.
159	
159	It was extremely dark, this passage, after the blinding sunlight reflected
159	from the sulphurous ground.  Its walls grew steep, and approached
159	each other.  Blotches of green and crimson drifted across my eyes.
159	My conductor stopped suddenly.  ""Home!"" said he, and I stood
159	in a floor of a chasm that was at first absolutely dark to me.
159	I heard some strange noises, and thrust the knuckles of my left hand
159	into my eyes.  I became aware of a disagreeable odor, like that of
159	a monkey's cage ill-cleaned. Beyond, the rock opened again upon
159	a gradual slope of sunlit greenery, and on either hand the light
159	smote down through narrow ways into the central gloom.
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	XII.  THE SAYERS OF THE LAW.
159	
159	
159	THEN something cold touched my hand.  I started violently,
159	and saw close to me a dim pinkish thing, looking more like a flayed
159	child than anything else in the world.  The creature had exactly
159	the mild but repulsive features of a sloth, the same low forehead
159	and slow gestures.
159	
159	As the first shock of the change of light passed, I saw about me
159	more distinctly.  The little sloth-like creature was standing and
159	staring at me.  My conductor had vanished.  The place was a narrow
159	passage between high walls of lava, a crack in the knotted rock,
159	and on either side interwoven heaps of sea-mat, palm-fans, and reeds
159	leaning against the rock formed rough and impenetrably dark dens.
159	The winding way up the ravine between these was scarcely three yards wide,
159	and was disfigured by lumps of decaying fruit-pulp and other refuse,
159	which accounted for the disagreeable stench of the place.
159	
159	The little pink sloth-creature was still blinking at me when my
159	Ape-man reappeared at the aperture of the nearest of these dens,
159	and beckoned me in.  As he did so a slouching monster wriggled out
159	of one of the places, further up this strange street, and stood up in
159	featureless silhouette against the bright green beyond, staring at me.
159	I hesitated, having half a mind to bolt the way I had come; and then,
159	determined to go through with the adventure, I gripped my nailed stick
159	about the middle and crawled into the little evil-smelling lean-to
159	after my conductor.
159	
159	It was a semi-circular space, shaped like the half of a bee-hive;
159	and against the rocky wall that formed the inner side of it was a pile
159	of variegated fruits, cocoa-nuts among others.  Some rough vessels
159	of lava and wood stood about the floor, and one on a rough stool.
159	There was no fire.  In the darkest corner of the hut sat a shapeless
159	mass of darkness that grunted ""Hey!"" as I came in, and my Ape-man
159	stood in the dim light of the doorway and held out a split cocoa-nut
159	to me as I crawled into the other corner and squatted down.
159	I took it, and began gnawing it, as serenely as possible, in spite of a
159	certain trepidation and the nearly intolerable closeness of the den.
159	The little pink sloth-creature stood in the aperture of the hut,
159	and something else with a drab face and bright eyes came staring over
159	its shoulder.
159	
159	""Hey!"" came out of the lump of mystery opposite.  ""It is a man.""
159	
159	""It is a man,"" gabbled my conductor, ""a man, a man, a five-man,
159	like me.""
159	
159	""Shut up!"" said the voice from the dark, and grunted.
159	I gnawed my cocoa-nut amid an impressive stillness.
159	
159	I peered hard into the blackness, but could distinguish nothing.
159	
159	""It is a man,"" the voice repeated.  ""He comes to live with us?""
159	
159	It was a thick voice, with something in it--a kind of whistling
159	overtone--that struck me as peculiar; but the English accent was
159	strangely good.
159	
159	The Ape-man looked at me as though he expected something.
159	I perceived the pause was interrogative.  ""He comes to live with you,""
159	I said.
159	
159	""It is a man.  He must learn the Law.""
159	
159	I began to distinguish now a deeper blackness in the black,
159	a vague outline of a hunched-up figure.  Then I noticed
159	the opening of the place was darkened by two more black heads.
159	My hand tightened on my stick.
159	
159	The thing in the dark repeated in a louder tone, ""Say the words.""
159	I had missed its last remark.  ""Not to go on all-fours; that is the Law,""
159	it repeated in a kind of sing-song.
159	
159	I was puzzled.
159	
159	""Say the words,"" said the Ape-man, repeating, and the figures
159	in the doorway echoed this, with a threat in the tone of their voices.
159	
159	I realised that I had to repeat this idiotic formula; and then
159	began the insanest ceremony.  The voice in the dark began intoning
159	a mad litany, line by line, and I and the rest to repeat it.
159	As they did so, they swayed from side to side in the oddest way,
159	and beat their hands upon their knees; and I followed their example.
159	I could have imagined I was already dead and in another world.
159	That dark hut, these grotesque dim figures, just flecked here and
159	there by a glimmer of light, and all of them swaying in unison and
159	chanting,
159	
159	     ""Not to go on all-fours; that is the Law.  Are we not Men?
159	     ""Not to suck up Drink; that is the Law.  Are we not Men?
159	     ""Not to eat Fish or Flesh; that is the Law.  Are we not Men?
159	     ""Not to claw the Bark of Trees; that is the Law.  Are we not Men?
159	     ""Not to chase other Men; that is the Law.  Are we not Men?""
159	
159	And so from the prohibition of these acts of folly,
159	on to the prohibition of what I thought then were the maddest,
159	most impossible, and most indecent things one could well imagine.
159	A kind of rhythmic fervour fell on all of us; we gabbled
159	and swayed faster and faster, repeating this amazing Law.
159	Superficially the contagion of these brutes was upon me, but deep
159	down within me the laughter and disgust struggled together.
159	We ran through a long list of prohibitions, and then the chant swung
159	round to a new formula.
159	
159	     ""_His_ is the House of Pain.
159	     ""_His_ is the Hand that makes.
159	     ""_His_ is the Hand that wounds.
159	     ""_His_ is the Hand that heals.""
159	
159	And so on for another long series, mostly quite incomprehensible
159	gibberish to me about _Him_, whoever he might be.  I could have fancied
159	it was a dream, but never before have I heard chanting in a dream.
159	
159	""_His_ is the lightning flash,"" we sang.  ""_His_ is the deep, salt sea.""
159	
159	A horrible fancy came into my head that Moreau, after animalising
159	these men, had infected their dwarfed brains with a kind of
159	deification of himself.  However, I was too keenly aware of white
159	teeth and strong claws about me to stop my chanting on that account.
159	
159	""_His_ are the stars in the sky.""
159	
159	At last that song ended.  I saw the Ape-man's face shining
159	with perspiration; and my eyes being now accustomed to the darkness,
159	I saw more distinctly the figure in the corner from which the voice came.
159	It was the size of a man, but it seemed covered with a dull grey
159	hair almost like a Skye-terrier. What was it?  What were they all?
159	Imagine yourself surrounded by all the most horrible cripples
159	and maniacs it is possible to conceive, and you may understand
159	a little of my feelings with these grotesque caricatures of humanity
159	about me.
159	
159	""He is a five-man, a five-man, a five-man--like me,"" said the Ape-man.
159	
159	I held out my hands.  The grey creature in the corner leant forward.
159	
159	""Not to run on all-fours; that is the Law.  Are we not Men?""
159	he said.
159	
159	He put out a strangely distorted talon and gripped my fingers.
159	The thing was almost like the hoof of a deer produced into claws.
159	I could have yelled with surprise and pain.  His face came
159	forward and peered at my nails, came forward into the light of
159	the opening of the hut and I saw with a quivering disgust that it
159	was like the face of neither man nor beast, but a mere shock
159	of grey hair, with three shadowy over-archings to mark the eyes
159	and mouth.
159	
159	""He has little nails,"" said this grisly creature in his hairy beard.
159	""It is well.""
159	
159	He threw my hand down, and instinctively I gripped my stick.
159	
159	""Eat roots and herbs; it is His will,"" said the Ape-man.
159	
159	""I am the Sayer of the Law,"" said the grey figure.  ""Here come
159	all that be new to learn the Law.  I sit in the darkness and say
159	the Law.""
159	
159	""It is even so,"" said one of the beasts in the doorway.
159	
159	""Evil are the punishments of those who break the Law.
159	None escape.""
159	
159	""None escape,"" said the Beast Folk, glancing furtively at one another.
159	
159	""None, none,"" said the Ape-man,--""none escape.  See!  I did a little thing,
159	a wrong thing, once.  I jabbered, jabbered, stopped talking.
159	None could understand.  I am burnt, branded in the hand.  He is great.
159	He is good!""
159	
159	""None escape,"" said the grey creature in the corner.
159	
159	""None escape,"" said the Beast People, looking askance at one another.
159	
159	""For every one the want that is bad,"" said the grey Sayer of the Law.
159	""What you will want we do not know; we shall know.  Some want
159	to follow things that move, to watch and slink and wait and spring;
159	to kill and bite, bite deep and rich, sucking the blood.
159	It is bad.  'Not to chase other Men; that is the Law.
159	Are we not Men?  Not to eat Flesh or Fish; that is the Law.  Are we
159	not Men?'""
159	
159	""None escape,"" said a dappled brute standing in the doorway.
159	
159	""For every one the want is bad,"" said the grey Sayer of the Law.
159	""Some want to go tearing with teeth and hands into the roots of things,
159	snuffing into the earth.  It is bad.""
159	
159	""None escape,"" said the men in the door.
159	
159	""Some go clawing trees; some go scratching at the graves of the dead;
159	some go fighting with foreheads or feet or claws; some bite suddenly,
159	none giving occasion; some love uncleanness.""
159	
159	""None escape,"" said the Ape-man, scratching his calf.
159	
159	""None escape,"" said the little pink sloth-creature.
159	
159	""Punishment is sharp and sure.  Therefore learn the Law.
159	Say the words.""
159	
159	And incontinently he began again the strange litany of the Law,
159	and again I and all these creatures began singing and swaying.
159	My head reeled with this jabbering and the close stench of the place;
159	but I kept on, trusting to find presently some chance of a
159	new development.
159	
159	""Not to go on all-fours; that is the Law.  Are we not Men?""
159	
159	We were making such a noise that I noticed nothing of a tumult outside,
159	until some one, who I think was one of the two Swine Men I
159	had seen, thrust his head over the little pink sloth-creature
159	and shouted something excitedly, something that I did not catch.
159	Incontinently those at the opening of the hut vanished; my Ape-man
159	rushed out; the thing that had sat in the dark followed him
159	(I only observed that it was big and clumsy, and covered with silvery
159	hair), and I was left alone.  Then before I reached the aperture I heard
159	the yelp of a staghound.
159	
159	In another moment I was standing outside the hovel, my chair-rail
159	in my hand, every muscle of me quivering.  Before me were the clumsy
159	backs of perhaps a score of these Beast People, their misshapen heads
159	half hidden by their shoulder-blades. They were gesticulating excitedly.
159	Other half-animal faces glared interrogation out of the hovels.
159	Looking in the direction in which they faced, I saw coming through
159	the haze under the trees beyond the end of the passage of dens the dark
159	figure and awful white face of Moreau.  He was holding the leaping
159	staghound back, and close behind him came Montgomery revolver
159	in hand.
159	
159	For a moment I stood horror-struck. I turned and saw the passage
159	behind me blocked by another heavy brute, with a huge grey
159	face and twinkling little eyes, advancing towards me.
159	I looked round and saw to the right of me and a half-dozen yards
159	in front of me a narrow gap in the wall of rock through which a ray
159	of light slanted into the shadows.
159	
159	""Stop!"" cried Moreau as I strode towards this, and then, ""Hold him!""
159	
159	At that, first one face turned towards me and then others.
159	Their bestial minds were happily slow.  I dashed my shoulder
159	into a clumsy monster who was turning to see what Moreau meant,
159	and flung him forward into another.  I felt his hands fly round,
159	clutching at me and missing me.  The little pink sloth-creature
159	dashed at me, and I gashed down its ugly face with the nail
159	in my stick and in another minute was scrambling up a steep
159	side pathway, a kind of sloping chimney, out of the ravine.
159	I heard a howl behind me, and cries of ""Catch him!""  ""Hold him!""
159	and the grey-faced creature appeared behind me and jammed
159	his huge bulk into the cleft.  ""Go on! go on!"" they howled.
159	I clambered up the narrow cleft in the rock and came out upon
159	the sulphur on the westward side of the village of the Beast Men.
159	
159	That gap was altogether fortunate for me, for the narrow chimney,
159	slanting obliquely upward, must have impeded the nearer pursuers.
159	I ran over the white space and down a steep slope,
159	through a scattered growth of trees, and came to a low-lying
159	stretch of tall reeds, through which I pushed into a dark,
159	thick undergrowth that was black and succulent under foot.
159	As I plunged into the reeds, my foremost pursuers emerged from the gap.
159	I broke my way through this undergrowth for some minutes.
159	The air behind me and about me was soon full of threatening cries.
159	I heard the tumult of my pursuers in the gap up the slope, then the
159	crashing of the reeds, and every now and then the crackling crash
159	of a branch.  Some of the creatures roared like excited beasts of prey.
159	The staghound yelped to the left.  I heard Moreau and Montgomery shouting
159	in the same direction.  I turned sharply to the right.  It seemed
159	to me even then that I heard Montgomery shouting for me to run for
159	my life.
159	
159	Presently the ground gave rich and oozy under my feet; but I was
159	desperate and went headlong into it, struggled through kneedeep,
159	and so came to a winding path among tall canes.  The noise of my
159	pursuers passed away to my left.  In one place three strange, pink,
159	hopping animals, about the size of cats, bolted before my footsteps.
159	This pathway ran up hill, across another open space covered
159	with white incrustation, and plunged into a canebrake again.
159	Then suddenly it turned parallel with the edge of a steep-walled gap,
159	which came without warning, like the ha-ha of an English park,--turned
159	with an unexpected abruptness.  I was still running with all
159	my might, and I never saw this drop until I was flying headlong through
159	the air.
159	
159	I fell on my forearms and head, among thorns, and rose with a torn
159	ear and bleeding face.  I had fallen into a precipitous ravine,
159	rocky and thorny, full of a hazy mist which drifted about me in wisps,
159	and with a narrow streamlet from which this mist came meandering
159	down the centre.  I was astonished at this thin fog in the full
159	blaze of daylight; but I had no time to stand wondering then.
159	I turned to my right, down-stream, hoping to come to the sea
159	in that direction, and so have my way open to drown myself.
159	It was only later I found that I had dropped my nailed stick in
159	my fall.
159	
159	Presently the ravine grew narrower for a space, and carelessly
159	I stepped into the stream.  I jumped out again pretty quickly,
159	for the water was almost boiling.  I noticed too there was a thin
159	sulphurous scum drifting upon its coiling water.  Almost immediately
159	came a turn in the ravine, and the indistinct blue horizon.
159	The nearer sea was flashing the sun from a myriad facets.
159	I saw my death before me; but I was hot and panting, with the warm
159	blood oozing out on my face and running pleasantly through my veins.
159	I felt more than a touch of exultation too, at having distanced
159	my pursuers.  It was not in me then to go out and drown myself yet.
159	I stared back the way I had come.
159	
159	I listened.  Save for the hum of the gnats and the chirp of some small
159	insects that hopped among the thorns, the air was absolutely still.
159	Then came the yelp of a dog, very faint, and a chattering and gibbering,
159	the snap of a whip, and voices.  They grew louder, then fainter again.
159	The noise receded up the stream and faded away.  For a while the chase
159	was over; but I knew now how much hope of help for me lay in the
159	Beast People.
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	XIII.  A PARLEY.
159	
159	
159	I TURNED again and went on down towards the sea.  I found the hot stream
159	broadened out to a shallow, weedy sand, in which an abundance of crabs
159	and long-bodied, many-legged creatures started from my footfall.
159	I walked to the very edge of the salt water, and then I felt I was safe.
159	I turned and stared, arms akimbo, at the thick green behind me,
159	into which the steamy ravine cut like a smoking gash.
159	But, as I say, I was too full of excitement and (a true saying,
159	though those who have never known danger may doubt it) too desperate
159	to die.
159	
159	Then it came into my head that there was one chance before me yet.
159	While Moreau and Montgomery and their bestial rabble chased me
159	through the island, might I not go round the beach until I came
159	to their enclosure,--make a flank march upon them, in fact,
159	and then with a rock lugged out of their loosely-built wall, perhaps,
159	smash in the lock of the smaller door and see what I could find
159	(knife, pistol, or what not) to fight them with when they returned?
159	It was at any rate something to try.
159	
159	So I turned to the westward and walked along by the water's edge.
159	The setting sun flashed his blinding heat into my eyes.
159	The slight Pacific tide was running in with a gentle ripple.
159	Presently the shore fell away southward, and the sun came round
159	upon my right hand.  Then suddenly, far in front of me, I saw
159	first one and then several figures emerging from the bushes,--Moreau,
159	with his grey staghound, then Montgomery, and two others.
159	At that I stopped.
159	
159	They saw me, and began gesticulating and advancing.  I stood watching
159	them approach.  The two Beast Men came running forward to cut me
159	off from the undergrowth, inland.  Montgomery came, running also,
159	but straight towards me.  Moreau followed slower with the dog.
159	
159	At last I roused myself from my inaction, and turning seaward walked
159	straight into the water.  The water was very shallow at first.
159	I was thirty yards out before the waves reached to my waist.
159	Dimly I could see the intertidal creatures darting away from
159	my feet.
159	
159	""What are you doing, man?"" cried Montgomery.
159	
159	I turned, standing waist deep, and stared at them.
159	Montgomery stood panting at the margin of the water.  His face
159	was bright-red with exertion, his long flaxen hair blown about
159	his head, and his dropping nether lip showed his irregular teeth.
159	Moreau was just coming up, his face pale and firm, and the dog at his
159	hand barked at me.  Both men had heavy whips.  Farther up the beach
159	stared the Beast Men.
159	
159	""What am I doing?  I am going to drown myself,"" said I.
159	
159	Montgomery and Moreau looked at each other.  ""Why?"" asked Moreau.
159	
159	""Because that is better than being tortured by you.""
159	
159	""I told you so,"" said Montgomery, and Moreau said something
159	in a low tone.
159	
159	""What makes you think I shall torture you?"" asked Moreau.
159	
159	""What I saw,"" I said.  ""And those--yonder.""
159	
159	""Hush!"" said Moreau, and held up his hand.
159	
159	""I will not,"" said I. ""They were men:  what are they now?
159	I at least will not be like them.""
159	
159	I looked past my interlocutors.  Up the beach were M'ling, Montgomery's
159	attendant, and one of the white-swathed brutes from the boat.
159	Farther up, in the shadow of the trees, I saw my little Ape-man,
159	and behind him some other dim figures.
159	
159	""Who are these creatures?"" said I, pointing to them and raising
159	my voice more and more that it might reach them.  ""They were men,
159	men like yourselves, whom you have infected with some bestial
159	taint,--men whom you have enslaved, and whom you still fear.
159	
159	""You who listen,"" I cried, pointing now to Moreau and shouting past
159	him to the Beast Men,--""You who listen!  Do you not see these men
159	still fear you, go in dread of you?  Why, then, do you fear them?
159	You are many--""
159	
159	""For God's sake,"" cried Montgomery, ""stop that, Prendick!""
159	
159	""Prendick!"" cried Moreau.
159	
159	They both shouted together, as if to drown my voice; and behind
159	them lowered the staring faces of the Beast Men, wondering,
159	their deformed hands hanging down, their shoulders hunched up.
159	They seemed, as I fancied, to be trying to understand me, to remember,
159	I thought, something of their human past.
159	
159	I went on shouting, I scarcely remember what,--that Moreau
159	and Montgomery could be killed, that they were not to be feared:
159	that was the burden of what I put into the heads of the Beast People.
159	I saw the green-eyed man in the dark rags, who had met me on
159	the evening of my arrival, come out from among the trees, and others
159	followed him, to hear me better.  At last for want of breath
159	I paused.
159	
159	""Listen to me for a moment,"" said the steady voice of Moreau;
159	""and then say what you will.""
159	
159	""Well?"" said I.
159	
159	He coughed, thought, then shouted:  ""Latin, Prendick! bad Latin,
159	schoolboy Latin; but try and understand.  Hi non sunt homines;
159	sunt animalia qui nos habemus--vivisected.  A humanising process.
159	I will explain.  Come ashore.""
159	
159	I laughed.  ""A pretty story,"" said I. ""They talk, build houses.
159	They were men.  It's likely I'll come ashore.""
159	
159	""The water just beyond where you stand is deep--and full of sharks.""
159	
159	""That's my way,"" said I. ""Short and sharp.  Presently.""
159	
159	""Wait a minute.""  He took something out of his pocket that flashed back
159	the sun, and dropped the object at his feet.  ""That's a loaded revolver,""
159	said he.  ""Montgomery here will do the same.  Now we are going
159	up the beach until you are satisfied the distance is safe.
159	Then come and take the revolvers.""
159	
159	""Not I!  You have a third between you.""
159	
159	""I want you to think over things, Prendick.  In the first place,
159	I never asked you to come upon this island.  If we vivisected men,
159	we should import men, not beasts.  In the next, we had you
159	drugged last night, had we wanted to work you any mischief;
159	and in the next, now your first panic is over and you can think
159	a little, is Montgomery here quite up to the character you give him?
159	We have chased you for your good.  Because this island is full
159	of inimical phenomena.  Besides, why should we want to shoot you
159	when you have just offered to drown yourself?""
159	
159	""Why did you set--your people onto me when I was in the hut?""
159	
159	""We felt sure of catching you, and bringing you out of danger.
159	Afterwards we drew away from the scent, for your good.""
159	
159	I mused.  It seemed just possible.  Then I remembered something again.
159	""But I saw,"" said I, ""in the enclosure--""
159	
159	""That was the puma.""
159	
159	""Look here, Prendick,"" said Montgomery, ""you're a silly ass!
159	Come out of the water and take these revolvers, and talk.
159	We can't do anything more than we could do now.""
159	
159	I will confess that then, and indeed always, I distrusted
159	and dreaded Moreau; but Montgomery was a man I felt I understood.
159	
159	""Go up the beach,"" said I, after thinking, and added, ""holding your
159	hands up.""
159	
159	""Can't do that,"" said Montgomery, with an explanatory nod over
159	his shoulder.  ""Undignified.""
159	
159	""Go up to the trees, then,"" said I, ""as you please.""
159	
159	""It's a damned silly ceremony,"" said Montgomery.
159	
159	Both turned and faced the six or seven grotesque creatures,
159	who stood there in the sunlight, solid, casting shadows, moving,
159	and yet so incredibly unreal.  Montgomery cracked his whip at them,
159	and forthwith they all turned and fled helter-skelter into the trees;
159	and when Montgomery and Moreau were at a distance I judged sufficient,
159	I waded ashore, and picked up and examined the revolvers.
159	To satisfy myself against the subtlest trickery, I discharged one at
159	a round lump of lava, and had the satisfaction of seeing the stone
159	pulverised and the beach splashed with lead.  Still I hesitated for
159	a moment.
159	
159	""I'll take the risk,"" said I, at last; and with a revolver in each
159	hand I walked up the beach towards them.
159	
159	""That's better,"" said Moreau, without affectation.  ""As it is, you have
159	wasted the best part of my day with your confounded imagination.""
159	And with a touch of contempt which humiliated me, he and Montgomery
159	turned and went on in silence before me.
159	
159	The knot of Beast Men, still wondering, stood back among the trees.
159	I passed them as serenely as possible.  One started to follow me,
159	but retreated again when Montgomery cracked his whip.  The rest
159	stood silent--watching.  They may once have been animals; but I never
159	before saw an animal trying to think.
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	XIV.  DOCTOR MOREAU EXPLAINS.
159	
159	
159	""AND now, Prendick, I will explain,"" said Doctor Moreau,
159	so soon as we had eaten and drunk.  ""I must confess that
159	you are the most dictatorial guest I ever entertained.
159	I warn you that this is the last I shall do to oblige you.
159	The next thing you threaten to commit suicide about, I shan't
159	do,--even at some personal inconvenience.""
159	
159	He sat in my deck chair, a cigar half consumed in his white,
159	dexterous-looking fingers.  The light of the swinging lamp fell on his
159	white hair; he stared through the little window out at the starlight.
159	I sat as far away from him as possible, the table between us
159	and the revolvers to hand.  Montgomery was not present.
159	I did not care to be with the two of them in such a little room.
159	
159	""You admit that the vivisected human being, as you called it, is,
159	after all, only the puma?"" said Moreau.  He had made me visit
159	that horror in the inner room, to assure myself of its inhumanity.
159	
159	""It is the puma,"" I said, ""still alive, but so cut and mutilated
159	as I pray I may never see living flesh again.  Of all vile--""
159	
159	""Never mind that,"" said Moreau; ""at least, spare me those
159	youthful horrors.  Montgomery used to be just the same.
159	You admit that it is the puma.  Now be quiet, while I reel off
159	my physiological lecture to you.""
159	
159	And forthwith, beginning in the tone of a man supremely bored,
159	but presently warming a little, he explained his work to me.
159	He was very simple and convincing.  Now and then there was a touch
159	of sarcasm in his voice.  Presently I found myself hot with shame at our
159	mutual positions.
159	
159	The creatures I had seen were not men, had never been men.
159	They were animals, humanised animals,--triumphs of vivisection.
159	
159	""You forget all that a skilled vivisector can do with living things,""
159	said Moreau.  ""For my own part, I'm puzzled why the things
159	I have done here have not been done before.  Small efforts,
159	of course, have been made,--amputation, tongue-cutting, excisions.
159	Of course you know a squint may be induced or cured by surgery?
159	Then in the case of excisions you have all kinds of secondary changes,
159	pigmentary disturbances, modifications of the passions, alterations in
159	the secretion of fatty tissue.  I have no doubt you have heard of
159	these things?""
159	
159	""Of course,"" said I. ""But these foul creatures of yours--""
159	
159	""All in good time,"" said he, waving his hand at me; ""I am only beginning.
159	Those are trivial cases of alteration.  Surgery can do better things
159	than that.  There is building up as well as breaking down and changing.
159	You have heard, perhaps, of a common surgical operation resorted to in
159	cases where the nose has been destroyed:  a flap of skin is cut from
159	the forehead, turned down on the nose, and heals in the new position.
159	This is a kind of grafting in a new position of part of an animal
159	upon itself.  Grafting of freshly obtained material from another
159	animal is also possible,--the case of teeth, for example.
159	The grafting of skin and bone is done to facilitate healing:
159	the surgeon places in the middle of the wound pieces of skin snipped
159	from another animal, or fragments of bone from a victim freshly killed.
159	Hunter's cock-spur--possibly you have heard of that--flourished on
159	the bull's neck; and the rhinoceros rats of the Algerian zouaves are
159	also to be thought of,--monsters manufactured by transferring a slip
159	from the tail of an ordinary rat to its snout, and allowing it to heal in
159	that position.""
159	
159	""Monsters manufactured!"" said I. ""Then you mean to tell me--""
159	
159	""Yes.  These creatures you have seen are animals carven and wrought
159	into new shapes.  To that, to the study of the plasticity of
159	living forms, my life has been devoted.  I have studied for years,
159	gaining in knowledge as I go.  I see you look horrified, and yet I
159	am telling you nothing new.  It all lay in the surface of practical
159	anatomy years ago, but no one had the temerity to touch it.
159	It is not simply the outward form of an animal which I can change.
159	The physiology, the chemical rhythm of the creature, may also be made
159	to undergo an enduring modification,--of which vaccination and other
159	methods of inoculation with living or dead matter are examples
159	that will, no doubt, be familiar to you.  A similar operation is
159	the transfusion of blood,--with which subject, indeed, I began.
159	These are all familiar cases.  Less so, and probably far more extensive,
159	were the operations of those mediaeval practitioners who made
159	dwarfs and beggar-cripples, show-monsters,--some vestiges of whose
159	art still remain in the preliminary manipulation of the young
159	mountebank or contortionist.  Victor Hugo gives an account of them
159	in 'L'Homme qui Rit.'--But perhaps my meaning grows plain now.
159	You begin to see that it is a possible thing to transplant tissue
159	from one part of an animal to another, or from one animal to another;
159	to alter its chemical reactions and methods of growth; to modify
159	the articulations of its limbs; and, indeed, to change it in its most
159	intimate structure.
159	
159	""And yet this extraordinary branch of knowledge has never been sought
159	as an end, and systematically, by modern investigators until I took it up!
159	Some such things have been hit upon in the last resort of surgery;
159	most of the kindred evidence that will recur to your mind has been
159	demonstrated as it were by accident,--by tyrants, by criminals,
159	by the breeders of horses and dogs, by all kinds of untrained
159	clumsy-handed men working for their own immediate ends.
159	I was the first man to take up this question armed with antiseptic surgery,
159	and with a really scientific knowledge of the laws of growth.
159	Yet one would imagine it must have been practised in secret before.
159	Such creatures as the Siamese Twins--And in the vaults of
159	the Inquisition.  No doubt their chief aim was artistic torture,
159	but some at least of the inquisitors must have had a touch of
159	scientific curiosity.""
159	
159	""But,"" said I, ""these things--these animals talk!""
159	
159	He said that was so, and proceeded to point out that the possibility
159	of vivisection does not stop at a mere physical metamorphosis.
159	A pig may be educated.  The mental structure is even less determinate
159	than the bodily.  In our growing science of hypnotism we find
159	the promise of a possibility of superseding old inherent instincts by
159	new suggestions, grafting upon or replacing the inherited fixed ideas.
159	Very much indeed of what we call moral education, he said,
159	is such an artificial modification and perversion of instinct;
159	pugnacity is trained into courageous self-sacrifice, and suppressed
159	sexuality into religious emotion.  And the great difference
159	between man and monkey is in the larynx, he continued,--in the
159	incapacity to frame delicately different sound-symbols by which
159	thought could be sustained.  In this I failed to agree with him,
159	but with a certain incivility he declined to notice my objection.
159	He repeated that the thing was so, and continued his account of
159	his work.
159	
159	I asked him why he had taken the human form as a model.
159	There seemed to me then, and there still seems to me now, a strange
159	wickedness for that choice.
159	
159	He confessed that he had chosen that form by chance.  ""I might just
159	as well have worked to form sheep into llamas and llamas into sheep.
159	I suppose there is something in the human form that appeals to
159	the artistic turn of mind more powerfully than any animal shape can.
159	But I've not confined myself to man-making. Once or twice--"" He was silent,
159	for a minute perhaps.  ""These years!  How they have slipped by!
159	And here I have wasted a day saving your life, and am now wasting an hour
159	explaining myself!""
159	
159	""But,"" said I, ""I still do not understand.  Where is your justification
159	for inflicting all this pain?  The only thing that could excuse
159	vivisection to me would be some application--""
159	
159	""Precisely,"" said he.  ""But, you see, I am differently constituted.
159	We are on different platforms.  You are a materialist.""
159	
159	""I am _not_ a materialist,"" I began hotly.
159	
159	""In my view--in my view.  For it is just this question of pain
159	that parts us.  So long as visible or audible pain turns you sick;
159	so long as your own pains drive you; so long as pain underlies
159	your propositions about sin,--so long, I tell you, you are
159	an animal, thinking a little less obscurely what an animal feels.
159	This pain--""
159	
159	I gave an impatient shrug at such sophistry.
159	
159	""Oh, but it is such a little thing!  A mind truly opened to
159	what science has to teach must see that it is a little thing.
159	It may be that save in this little planet, this speck of cosmic dust,
159	invisible long before the nearest star could be attained--it may be,
159	I say, that nowhere else does this thing called pain occur.
159	But the laws we feel our way towards--Why, even on this earth, even among
159	living things, what pain is there?""
159	
159	As he spoke he drew a little penknife from his pocket, opened the
159	smaller blade, and moved his chair so that I could see his thigh.
159	Then, choosing the place deliberately, he drove the blade into
159	his leg and withdrew it.
159	
159	""No doubt,"" he said, ""you have seen that before.  It does not hurt
159	a pin-prick. But what does it show?  The capacity for pain is not
159	needed in the muscle, and it is not placed there,--is but little
159	needed in the skin, and only here and there over the thigh is
159	a spot capable of feeling pain.  Pain is simply our intrinsic
159	medical adviser to warn us and stimulate us.  Not all living
159	flesh is painful; nor is all nerve, not even all sensory nerve.
159	There's no taint of pain, real pain, in the sensations of the optic
159	nerve.  If you wound the optic nerve, you merely see flashes of
159	light,--just as disease of the auditory nerve merely means a humming
159	in our ears.  Plants do not feel pain, nor the lower animals;
159	it's possible that such animals as the starfish and crayfish do not
159	feel pain at all.  Then with men, the more intelligent they become,
159	the more intelligently they will see after their own welfare,
159	and the less they will need the goad to keep them out of danger.
159	I never yet heard of a useless thing that was not ground out
159	of existence by evolution sooner or later.  Did you?  And pain
159	gets needless.
159	
159	""Then I am a religious man, Prendick, as every sane man must be.
159	It may be, I fancy, that I have seen more of the ways of this world's
159	Maker than you,--for I have sought his laws, in _my_ way, all my life,
159	while you, I understand, have been collecting butterflies.
159	And I tell you, pleasure and pain have nothing to do with heaven or hell.
159	Pleasure and pain--bah!  What is your theologian's ecstasy but
159	Mahomet's houri in the dark?  This store which men and women set
159	on pleasure and pain, Prendick, is the mark of the beast upon
159	them,--the mark of the beast from which they came!  Pain, pain and
159	pleasure, they are for us only so long as we wriggle in the dust.
159	
159	""You see, I went on with this research just the way it led me.
159	That is the only way I ever heard of true research going.
159	I asked a question, devised some method of obtaining an answer,
159	and got a fresh question.  Was this possible or that possible?
159	You cannot imagine what this means to an investigator,
159	what an intellectual passion grows upon him!  You cannot imagine
159	the strange, colourless delight of these intellectual desires!
159	The thing before you is no longer an animal, a fellow-creature,
159	but a problem!  Sympathetic pain,--all I know of it I remember
159	as a thing I used to suffer from years ago.  I wanted--it was
159	the one thing I wanted--to find out the extreme limit of plasticity
159	in a living shape.""
159	
159	""But,"" said I, ""the thing is an abomination--""
159	
159	""To this day I have never troubled about the ethics of the matter,""
159	he continued.  ""The study of Nature makes a man at last as remorseless
159	as Nature.  I have gone on, not heeding anything but the question I
159	was pursuing; and the material has--dripped into the huts yonder.
159	It is nearly eleven years since we came here, I and Montgomery
159	and six Kanakas.  I remember the green stillness of the island
159	and the empty ocean about us, as though it was yesterday.
159	The place seemed waiting for me.
159	
159	""The stores were landed and the house was built.  The Kanakas founded
159	some huts near the ravine.  I went to work here upon what I had brought
159	with me.  There were some disagreeable things happened at first.
159	I began with a sheep, and killed it after a day and a half by a slip
159	of the scalpel.  I took another sheep, and made a thing of pain and fear
159	and left it bound up to heal.  It looked quite human to me when I
159	had finished it; but when I went to it I was discontented with it.
159	It remembered me, and was terrified beyond imagination; and it had no
159	more than the wits of a sheep.  The more I looked at it the clumsier
159	it seemed, until at last I put the monster out of its misery.
159	These animals without courage, these fear-haunted, pain-driven things,
159	without a spark of pugnacious energy to face torment,--they are no good for
159	man-making.
159	
159	""Then I took a gorilla I had; and upon that, working with infinite
159	care and mastering difficulty after difficulty, I made my first man.
159	All the week, night and day, I moulded him.  With him it was chiefly
159	the brain that needed moulding; much had to be added, much changed.
159	I thought him a fair specimen of the negroid type when I had
159	finished him, and he lay bandaged, bound, and motionless before me.
159	It was only when his life was assured that I left him and came
159	into this room again, and found Montgomery much as you are.
159	He had heard some of the cries as the thing grew human,--cries
159	like those that disturbed _you_ so.  I didn't take him
159	completely into my confidence at first.  And the Kanakas too,
159	had realised something of it.  They were scared out of their wits
159	by the sight of me.  I got Montgomery over to me--in a way;
159	but I and he had the hardest job to prevent the Kanakas deserting.
159	Finally they did; and so we lost the yacht.  I spent many days
159	educating the brute,--altogether I had him for three or four months.
159	I taught him the rudiments of English; gave him ideas of counting;
159	even made the thing read the alphabet.  But at that he was slow,
159	though I've met with idiots slower.  He began with a clean sheet,
159	mentally; had no memories left in his mind of what he had been.
159	When his scars were quite healed, and he was no longer anything
159	but painful and stiff, and able to converse a little, I took
159	him yonder and introduced him to the Kanakas as an interesting
159	stowaway.
159	
159	""They were horribly afraid of him at first, somehow,--which offended
159	me rather, for I was conceited about him; but his ways seemed so mild,
159	and he was so abject, that after a time they received him and took his
159	education in hand.  He was quick to learn, very imitative and adaptive,
159	and built himself a hovel rather better, it seemed to me, than their
159	own shanties.  There was one among the boys a bit of a missionary,
159	and he taught the thing to read, or at least to pick out letters,
159	and gave him some rudimentary ideas of morality; but it seems
159	the beast's habits were not all that is desirable.
159	
159	""I rested from work for some days after this, and was in a mind to
159	write an account of the whole affair to wake up English physiology.
159	Then I came upon the creature squatting up in a tree and gibbering
159	at two of the Kanakas who had been teasing him.  I threatened him,
159	told him the inhumanity of such a proceeding, aroused his sense of shame,
159	and came home resolved to do better before I took my work back to England.
159	I have been doing better.  But somehow the things drift back again:
159	the stubborn beast-flesh grows day by day back again.
159	But I mean to do better things still.  I mean to conquer that.
159	This puma--
159	
159	""But that's the story.  All the Kanaka boys are dead now;
159	one fell overboard of the launch, and one died of a wounded
159	heel that he poisoned in some way with plant-juice. Three
159	went away in the yacht, and I suppose and hope were drowned.
159	The other one--was killed.  Well, I have replaced them.
159	Montgomery went on much as you are disposed to do at first,
159	and then--
159	
159	""What became of the other one?"" said I, sharply,--""the other Kanaka
159	who was killed?""
159	
159	""The fact is, after I had made a number of human creatures I made
159	a Thing--""  He hesitated.
159	
159	""Yes?"" said I.
159	
159	""It was killed.""
159	
159	""I don't understand,"" said I; ""do you mean to say--""
159	
159	""It killed the Kanaka--yes.  It killed several other things that
159	it caught.  We chased it for a couple of days.  It only got loose
159	by accident--I never meant it to get away.  It wasn't finished.
159	It was purely an experiment.  It was a limbless thing, with a
159	horrible face, that writhed along the ground in a serpentine fashion.
159	It was immensely strong, and in infuriating pain.  It lurked in
159	the woods for some days, until we hunted it; and then it wriggled
159	into the northern part of the island, and we divided the party
159	to close in upon it.  Montgomery insisted upon coming with me.
159	The man had a rifle; and when his body was found, one of the barrels
159	was curved into the shape of an S and very nearly bitten through.
159	Montgomery shot the thing.  After that I stuck to the ideal of
159	humanity--except for little things.""
159	
159	He became silent.  I sat in silence watching his face.
159	
159	""So for twenty years altogether--counting nine years in England--I
159	have been going on; and there is still something in everything I do
159	that defeats me, makes me dissatisfied, challenges me to further effort.
159	Sometimes I rise above my level, sometimes I fall below it; but always
159	I fall short of the things I dream.  The human shape I can get now,
159	almost with ease, so that it is lithe and graceful, or thick and strong;
159	but often there is trouble with the hands and the claws,--painful things,
159	that I dare not shape too freely.  But it is in the subtle grafting
159	and reshaping one must needs do to the brain that my trouble lies.
159	The intelligence is often oddly low, with unaccountable blank ends,
159	unexpected gaps.  And least satisfactory of all is something that I
159	cannot touch, somewhere--I cannot determine where--in the seat
159	of the emotions.  Cravings, instincts, desires that harm humanity,
159	a strange hidden reservoir to burst forth suddenly and inundate
159	the whole being of the creature with anger, hate, or fear.
159	These creatures of mine seemed strange and uncanny to you so soon
159	as you began to observe them; but to me, just after I make them,
159	they seem to be indisputably human beings.  It's afterwards, as I
159	observe them, that the persuasion fades.  First one animal trait,
159	then another, creeps to the surface and stares out at me.
159	But I will conquer yet!  Each time I dip a living creature into the bath
159	of burning pain, I say, 'This time I will burn out all the animal;
159	this time I will make a rational creature of my own!'  After all,
159	what is ten years?  Men have been a hundred thousand in the making.""
159	He thought darkly.  ""But I am drawing near the fastness.
159	This puma of mine--"" After a silence, ""And they revert.
159	As soon as my hand is taken from them the beast begins
159	to creep back, begins to assert itself again.""  Another long
159	silence.
159	
159	""Then you take the things you make into those dens?"" said I.
159	
159	""They go.  I turn them out when I begin to feel the beast in them,
159	and presently they wander there.  They all dread this house and me.
159	There is a kind of travesty of humanity over there.  Montgomery knows
159	about it, for he interferes in their affairs.  He has trained one
159	or two of them to our service.  He's ashamed of it, but I believe
159	he half likes some of those beasts.  It's his business, not mine.
159	They only sicken me with a sense of failure.  I take no interest in them.
159	I fancy they follow in the lines the Kanaka missionary marked out,
159	and have a kind of mockery of a rational life, poor beasts!
159	There's something they call the Law.  Sing hymns about 'all thine.'
159	They build themselves their dens, gather fruit, and pull herbs--marry
159	even.  But I can see through it all, see into their very souls,
159	and see there nothing but the souls of beasts, beasts that perish,
159	anger and the lusts to live and gratify themselves.--Yet they're odd;
159	complex, like everything else alive.  There is a kind of upward
159	striving in them, part vanity, part waste sexual emotion,
159	part waste curiosity.  It only mocks me.  I have some hope of this puma.
159	I have worked hard at her head and brain--
159	
159	""And now,"" said he, standing up after a long gap of silence, during
159	which we had each pursued our own thoughts, ""what do you think?  Are
159	you in fear of me still?""
159	
159	I looked at him, and saw but a white-faced, white-haired man,
159	with calm eyes.  Save for his serenity, the touch almost of beauty that
159	resulted from his set tranquillity and his magnificent build, he might
159	have passed muster among a hundred other comfortable old gentlemen.
159	Then I shivered.  By way of answer to his second question, I handed
159	him a revolver with either hand.
159	
159	""Keep them,"" he said, and snatched at a yawn.  He stood up, stared at
159	me for a moment, and smiled.  ""You have had two eventful days,""
159	said he.  ""I should advise some sleep.  I'm glad it's all clear.
159	Good-night."" He thought me over for a moment, then went out by
159	the inner door.
159	
159	I immediately turned the key in the outer one.  I sat down again;
159	sat for a time in a kind of stagnant mood, so weary, emotionally,
159	mentally, and physically, that I could not think beyond the point
159	at which he had left me.  The black window stared at me like an eye.
159	At last with an effort I put out the light and got into the hammock.
159	Very soon I was asleep.
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	XV.  CONCERNING THE BEAST FOLK.
159	
159	
159	I WOKE early.  Moreau's explanation stood before my mind,
159	clear and definite, from the moment of my awakening.  I got out
159	of the hammock and went to the door to assure myself that the key
159	was turned.  Then I tried the window-bar, and found it firmly fixed.
159	That these man-like creatures were in truth only bestial monsters,
159	mere grotesque travesties of men, filled me with a vague uncertainty
159	of their possibilities which was far worse than any definite fear.
159	
159	A tapping came at the door, and I heard the glutinous accents
159	of M'ling speaking.  I pocketed one of the revolvers (keeping one
159	hand upon it), and opened to him.
159	
159	""Good-morning, sair,"" he said, bringing in, in addition to the customary
159	herb-breakfast, an ill-cooked rabbit.  Montgomery followed him.
159	His roving eye caught the position of my arm and he smiled askew.
159	
159	The puma was resting to heal that day; but Moreau, who was singularly
159	solitary in his habits, did not join us.  I talked with Montgomery
159	to clear my ideas of the way in which the Beast Folk lived.
159	In particular, I was urgent to know how these inhuman monsters were kept
159	from falling upon Moreau and Montgomery and from rending one another.
159	He explained to me that the comparative safety of Moreau and
159	himself was due to the limited mental scope of these monsters.
159	In spite of their increased intelligence and the tendency of their
159	animal instincts to reawaken, they had certain fixed ideas implanted
159	by Moreau in their minds, which absolutely bounded their imaginations.
159	They were really hypnotised; had been told that certain things
159	were impossible, and that certain things were not to be done,
159	and these prohibitions were woven into the texture of their minds beyond
159	any possibility of disobedience or dispute.
159	
159	Certain matters, however, in which old instinct was at war
159	with Moreau's convenience, were in a less stable condition.
159	A series of propositions called the Law (I had already heard them recited)
159	battled in their minds with the deep-seated, ever-rebellious cravings
159	of their animal natures.  This Law they were ever repeating,
159	I found, and ever breaking.  Both Montgomery and Moreau displayed
159	particular solicitude to keep them ignorant of the taste of blood;
159	they feared the inevitable suggestions of that flavour.
159	Montgomery told me that the Law, especially among the feline Beast People,
159	became oddly weakened about nightfall; that then the animal was at
159	its strongest; that a spirit of adventure sprang up in them at the dusk,
159	when they would dare things they never seemed to dream about by day.
159	To that I owed my stalking by the Leopard-man, on the night of my arrival.
159	But during these earlier days of my stay they broke the Law only
159	furtively and after dark; in the daylight there was a general
159	atmosphere of respect for its multifarious prohibitions.
159	
159	And here perhaps I may give a few general facts about the island
159	and the Beast People.  The island, which was of irregular outline
159	and lay low upon the wide sea, had a total area, I suppose,
159	of seven or eight square miles.{2} It was volcanic in origin,
159	and was now fringed on three sides by coral reefs; some fumaroles
159	to the northward, and a hot spring, were the only vestiges of
159	the forces that had long since originated it.  Now and then a faint
159	quiver of earthquake would be sensible, and sometimes the ascent
159	of the spire of smoke would be rendered tumultuous by gusts of steam;
159	but that was all.  The population of the island, Montgomery informed me,
159	now numbered rather more than sixty of these strange creations
159	of Moreau's art, not counting the smaller monstrosities
159	which lived in the undergrowth and were without human form.
159	Altogether he had made nearly a hundred and twenty; but many had died,
159	and others--like the writhing Footless Thing of which he had told
159	me--had come by violent ends.  In answer to my question, Montgomery
159	said that they actually bore offspring, but that these generally died.
159	When they lived, Moreau took them and stamped the human form upon them.
159	There was no evidence of the inheritance of their acquired
159	human characteristics.  The females were less numerous than the males,
159	and liable to much furtive persecution in spite of the monogamy the
159	Law enjoined.
159	
159	     {2} This description corresponds in every respect to Noble's Isle.
159	         -- C. E. P.
159	
159	It would be impossible for me to describe these Beast People in detail;
159	my eye has had no training in details, and unhappily I cannot sketch.
159	Most striking, perhaps, in their general appearance was the
159	disproportion between the legs of these creatures and the length
159	of their bodies; and yet--so relative is our idea of grace--my
159	eye became habituated to their forms, and at last I even fell
159	in with their persuasion that my own long thighs were ungainly.
159	Another point was the forward carriage of the head and the clumsy
159	and inhuman curvature of the spine.  Even the Ape-man lacked
159	that inward sinuous curve of the back which makes the human
159	figure so graceful.  Most had their shoulders hunched clumsily,
159	and their short forearms hung weakly at their sides.  Few of them
159	were conspicuously hairy, at least until the end of my time upon
159	the island.
159	
159	The next most obvious deformity was in their faces,
159	almost all of which were prognathous, malformed about the ears,
159	with large and protuberant noses, very furry or very bristly hair,
159	and often strangely-coloured or strangely-placed eyes.
159	None could laugh, though the Ape-man had a chattering titter.
159	Beyond these general characters their heads had little in common;
159	each preserved the quality of its particular species:
159	the human mark distorted but did not hide the leopard, the ox,
159	or the sow, or other animal or animals, from which the creature
159	had been moulded.  The voices, too, varied exceedingly.
159	The hands were always malformed; and though some surprised me by their
159	unexpected human appearance, almost all were deficient in the number
159	of the digits, clumsy about the finger-nails, and lacking any
159	tactile sensibility.
159	
159	The two most formidable Animal Men were my Leopard-man and a creature
159	made of hyena and swine.  Larger than these were the three bull-creatures
159	who pulled in the boat.  Then came the silvery-hairy-man, who was also
159	the Sayer of the Law, M'ling, and a satyr-like creature of ape and goat.
159	There were three Swine-men and a Swine-woman, a mare-rhinoceros-creature,
159	and several other females whose sources I did not ascertain.
159	There were several wolf-creatures, a bear-bull, and a Saint-Bernard-man. I
159	have already described the Ape-man, and there was a particularly hateful
159	(and evil-smelling) old woman made of vixen and bear, whom I hated
159	from the beginning.  She was said to be a passionate votary of the Law.
159	Smaller creatures were certain dappled youths and my little
159	sloth-creature. But enough of this catalogue.
159	
159	At first I had a shivering horror of the brutes, felt all too keenly
159	that they were still brutes; but insensibly I became a little
159	habituated to the idea of them, and moreover I was affected by
159	Montgomery's attitude towards them.  He had been with them so long
159	that he had come to regard them as almost normal human beings.
159	His London days seemed a glorious, impossible past to him.
159	Only once in a year or so did he go to Arica to deal with
159	Moreau's agent, a trader in animals there.  He hardly met the finest
159	type of mankind in that seafaring village of Spanish mongrels.
159	The men aboard-ship, he told me, seemed at first just as strange
159	to him as the Beast Men seemed to me,--unnaturally long in the leg,
159	flat in the face, prominent in the forehead, suspicious, dangerous,
159	and cold-hearted. In fact, he did not like men:  his heart
159	had warmed to me, he thought, because he had saved my life.
159	I fancied even then that he had a sneaking kindness for some of these
159	metamorphosed brutes, a vicious sympathy with some of their ways,
159	but that he attempted to veil it from me at first.
159	
159	M'ling, the black-faced man, Montgomery's attendant, the first of
159	the Beast Folk I had encountered, did not live with the others across
159	the island, but in a small kennel at the back of the enclosure.
159	The creature was scarcely so intelligent as the Ape-man, but far
159	more docile, and the most human-looking of all the Beast Folk;
159	and Montgomery had trained it to prepare food, and indeed to
159	discharge all the trivial domestic offices that were required.
159	It was a complex trophy of Moreau's horrible skill,--a bear, tainted with
159	dog and ox, and one of the most elaborately made of all his creatures.
159	It treated Montgomery with a strange tenderness and devotion.
159	Sometimes he would notice it, pat it, call it half-mocking, half-jocular
159	names, and so make it caper with extraordinary delight; sometimes he
159	would ill-treat it, especially after he had been at the whiskey,
159	kicking it, beating it, pelting it with stones or lighted fusees.
159	But whether he treated it well or ill, it loved nothing so much as to be
159	near him.
159	
159	I say I became habituated to the Beast People, that a thousand
159	things which had seemed unnatural and repulsive speedily became
159	natural and ordinary to me.  I suppose everything in existence
159	takes its colour from the average hue of our surroundings.
159	Montgomery and Moreau were too peculiar and individual
159	to keep my general impressions of humanity well defined.
159	I would see one of the clumsy bovine-creatures who worked the launch
159	treading heavily through the undergrowth, and find myself asking,
159	trying hard to recall, how he differed from some really human
159	yokel trudging home from his mechanical labours; or I would meet
159	the Fox-bear woman's vulpine, shifty face, strangely human in its
159	speculative cunning, and even imagine I had met it before in some
159	city byway.
159	
159	Yet every now and then the beast would flash out upon me beyond
159	doubt or denial.  An ugly-looking man, a hunch-backed human savage
159	to all appearance, squatting in the aperture of one of the dens,
159	would stretch his arms and yawn, showing with startling suddenness
159	scissor-edged incisors and sabre-like canines, keen and brilliant
159	as knives.  Or in some narrow pathway, glancing with a transitory
159	daring into the eyes of some lithe, white-swathed female figure,
159	I would suddenly see (with a spasmodic revulsion) that she had
159	slit-like pupils, or glancing down note the curving nail with which
159	she held her shapeless wrap about her.  It is a curious thing, by
159	the bye, for which I am quite unable to account, that these weird
159	creatures--the females, I mean--had in the earlier days of my stay an
159	instinctive sense of their own repulsive clumsiness, and displayed
159	in consequence a more than human regard for the decency and decorum
159	of extensive costume.
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	XVI.  HOW THE BEAST FOLK TASTE BLOOD.
159	
159	
159	MY inexperience as a writer betrays me, and I wander from the thread
159	of my story.
159	
159	After I had breakfasted with Montgomery, he took me across
159	the island to see the fumarole and the source of the hot spring
159	into whose scalding waters I had blundered on the previous day.
159	Both of us carried whips and loaded revolvers.  While going through
159	a leafy jungle on our road thither, we heard a rabbit squealing.
159	We stopped and listened, but we heard no more; and presently we
159	went on our way, and the incident dropped out of our minds.
159	Montgomery called my attention to certain little pink animals
159	with long hind-legs, that went leaping through the undergrowth.
159	He told me they were creatures made of the offspring of the Beast People,
159	that Moreau had invented.  He had fancied they might serve for meat,
159	but a rabbit-like habit of devouring their young had defeated
159	this intention.  I had already encountered some of these
159	creatures,--once during my moonlight flight from the Leopard-man,
159	and once during my pursuit by Moreau on the previous day.
159	By chance, one hopping to avoid us leapt into the hole caused
159	by the uprooting of a wind-blown tree; before it could extricate
159	itself we managed to catch it.  It spat like a cat, scratched and
159	kicked vigorously with its hind-legs, and made an attempt to bite;
159	but its teeth were too feeble to inflict more than a painless pinch.
159	It seemed to me rather a pretty little creature; and as Montgomery stated
159	that it never destroyed the turf by burrowing, and was very cleanly
159	in its habits, I should imagine it might prove a convenient substitute
159	for the common rabbit in gentlemen's parks.
159	
159	We also saw on our way the trunk of a tree barked in long strips
159	and splintered deeply.  Montgomery called my attention to this.
159	""Not to claw bark of trees, _that_ is the Law,"" he said.
159	""Much some of them care for it!""  It was after this, I think, that we
159	met the Satyr and the Ape-man. The Satyr was a gleam of classical memory
159	on the part of Moreau,--his face ovine in expression, like the coarser
159	Hebrew type; his voice a harsh bleat, his nether extremities Satanic.
159	He was gnawing the husk of a pod-like fruit as he passed us.
159	Both of them saluted Montgomery.
159	
159	""Hail,"" said they, ""to the Other with the Whip!""
159	
159	""There's a Third with a Whip now,"" said Montgomery.  ""So you'd
159	better mind!""
159	
159	""Was he not made?"" said the Ape-man. ""He said--he said he was made.""
159	
159	The Satyr-man looked curiously at me.  ""The Third with the Whip,
159	he that walks weeping into the sea, has a thin white face.""
159	
159	""He has a thin long whip,"" said Montgomery.
159	
159	""Yesterday he bled and wept,"" said the Satyr.  ""You never bleed nor weep.
159	The Master does not bleed or weep.""
159	
159	""Ollendorffian beggar!"" said Montgomery, ""you'll bleed and weep
159	if you don't look out!""
159	
159	""He has five fingers, he is a five-man like me,"" said the Ape-man.
159	
159	""Come along, Prendick,"" said Montgomery, taking my arm; and I went
159	on with him.
159	
159	The Satyr and the Ape-man stood watching us and making other remarks
159	to each other.
159	
159	""He says nothing,"" said the Satyr.  ""Men have voices.""
159	
159	""Yesterday he asked me of things to eat,"" said the Ape-man. ""He
159	did not know.""
159	
159	Then they spoke inaudible things, and I heard the Satyr laughing.
159	
159	It was on our way back that we came upon the dead rabbit.
159	The red body of the wretched little beast was rent to pieces, many of
159	the ribs stripped white, and the backbone indisputably gnawed.
159	
159	At that Montgomery stopped.  ""Good God!"" said he, stooping down,
159	and picking up some of the crushed vertebrae to examine them more closely.
159	""Good God!"" he repeated, ""what can this mean?""
159	
159	""Some carnivore of yours has remembered its old habits,""
159	I said after a pause.  ""This backbone has been bitten through.""
159	
159	He stood staring, with his face white and his lip pulled askew.
159	""I don't like this,"" he said slowly.
159	
159	""I saw something of the same kind,"" said I, ""the first day I came here.""
159	
159	""The devil you did!  What was it?""
159	
159	""A rabbit with its head twisted off.""
159	
159	""The day you came here?""
159	
159	""The day I came here.  In the undergrowth at the back of the enclosure,
159	when I went out in the evening.  The head was completely wrung off.""
159	
159	He gave a long, low whistle.
159	
159	""And what is more, I have an idea which of your brutes did the thing.
159	It's only a suspicion, you know.  Before I came on the rabbit I saw one
159	of your monsters drinking in the stream.""
159	
159	""Sucking his drink?""
159	
159	""Yes.""
159	
159	""'Not to suck your drink; that is the Law.'  Much the brutes care
159	for the Law, eh? when Moreau's not about!""
159	
159	""It was the brute who chased me.""
159	
159	""Of course,"" said Montgomery; ""it's just the way with carnivores.
159	After a kill, they drink.  It's the taste of blood, you know.--What
159	was the brute like?"" he continued.  ""Would you know him again?""
159	He glanced about us, standing astride over the mess of dead rabbit,
159	his eyes roving among the shadows and screens of greenery,
159	the lurking-places and ambuscades of the forest that bounded us in.
159	""The taste of blood,"" he said again.
159	
159	He took out his revolver, examined the cartridges in it and replaced it.
159	Then he began to pull at his dropping lip.
159	
159	""I think I should know the brute again,"" I said.  ""I stunned him.
159	He ought to have a handsome bruise on the forehead of him.""
159	
159	""But then we have to _prove_ that he killed the rabbit,"" said
159	Montgomery. ""I wish I'd never brought the things here.""
159	
159	I should have gone on, but he stayed there thinking over the mangled
159	rabbit in a puzzle-headed way.  As it was, I went to such a distance
159	that the rabbit's remains were hidden.
159	
159	""Come on!"" I said.
159	
159	Presently he woke up and came towards me.  ""You see,"" he said,
159	almost in a whisper, ""they are all supposed to have a fixed idea
159	against eating anything that runs on land.  If some brute has
159	by any accident tasted blood--""
159	
159	We went on some way in silence.  ""I wonder what can have happened,""
159	he said to himself.  Then, after a pause again:  ""I did a foolish
159	thing the other day.  That servant of mine--I showed him how to skin
159	and cook a rabbit.  It's odd--I saw him licking his hands--It never
159	occurred to me.""
159	
159	Then:  ""We must put a stop to this.  I must tell Moreau.""
159	
159	He could think of nothing else on our homeward journey.
159	
159	Moreau took the matter even more seriously than Montgomery, and I
159	need scarcely say that I was affected by their evident consternation.
159	
159	""We must make an example,"" said Moreau.  ""I've no doubt in my own
159	mind that the Leopard-man was the sinner.  But how can we prove it?
159	I wish, Montgomery, you had kept your taste for meat in hand, and gone
159	without these exciting novelties.  We may find ourselves in a mess yet,
159	through it.""
159	
159	""I was a silly ass,"" said Montgomery.  ""But the thing's done now;
159	and you said I might have them, you know.""
159	
159	""We must see to the thing at once,"" said Moreau.  ""I suppose
159	if anything should turn up, M'ling can take care of himself?""
159	
159	""I'm not so sure of M'ling,"" said Montgomery.  ""I think I ought
159	to know him.""
159	
159	In the afternoon, Moreau, Montgomery, myself, and M'ling went
159	across the island to the huts in the ravine.  We three were armed;
159	M'ling carried the little hatchet he used in chopping firewood,
159	and some coils of wire.  Moreau had a huge cowherd's horn slung over
159	his shoulder.
159	
159	""You will see a gathering of the Beast People,"" said Montgomery.
159	""It is a pretty sight!""
159	
159	Moreau said not a word on the way, but the expression of his heavy,
159	white-fringed face was grimly set.
159	
159	We crossed the ravine down which smoked the stream of hot water,
159	and followed the winding pathway through the canebrakes
159	until we reached a wide area covered over with a thick,
159	powdery yellow substance which I believe was sulphur.
159	Above the shoulder of a weedy bank the sea glittered.  We came to a kind
159	of shallow natural amphitheatre, and here the four of us halted.
159	Then Moreau sounded the horn, and broke the sleeping stillness
159	of the tropical afternoon.  He must have had strong lungs.
159	The hooting note rose and rose amidst its echoes, to at last an
159	ear-penetrating intensity.
159	
159	""Ah!"" said Moreau, letting the curved instrument fall to his side again.
159	
159	Immediately there was a crashing through the yellow canes,
159	and a sound of voices from the dense green jungle that marked
159	the morass through which I had run on the previous day.
159	Then at three or four points on the edge of the sulphurous area
159	appeared the grotesque forms of the Beast People hurrying towards us.
159	I could not help a creeping horror, as I perceived first one and then
159	another trot out from the trees or reeds and come shambling along
159	over the hot dust.  But Moreau and Montgomery stood calmly enough;
159	and, perforce, I stuck beside them.
159	
159	First to arrive was the Satyr, strangely unreal for all that he cast
159	a shadow and tossed the dust with his hoofs.  After him from
159	the brake came a monstrous lout, a thing of horse and rhinoceros,
159	chewing a straw as it came; then appeared the Swine-woman
159	and two Wolf-women; then the Fox-bear witch, with her red eyes
159	in her peaked red face, and then others,--all hurrying eagerly.
159	As they came forward they began to cringe towards Moreau and chant,
159	quite regardless of one another, fragments of the latter half
159	of the litany of the Law,--""His is the Hand that wounds;
159	His is the Hand that heals,"" and so forth.  As soon as they had
159	approached within a distance of perhaps thirty yards they halted,
159	and bowing on knees and elbows began flinging the white dust upon
159	their heads.
159	
159	Imagine the scene if you can!  We three blue-clad men, with our
159	misshapen black-faced attendant, standing in a wide expanse
159	of sunlit yellow dust under the blazing blue sky, and surrounded
159	by this circle of crouching and gesticulating monstrosities,--some
159	almost human save in their subtle expression and gestures,
159	some like cripples, some so strangely distorted as to resemble nothing
159	but the denizens of our wildest dreams; and, beyond, the reedy
159	lines of a canebrake in one direction, a dense tangle of palm-trees
159	on the other, separating us from the ravine with the huts,
159	and to the north the hazy horizon of the Pacific Ocean.
159	
159	""Sixty-two, sixty-three,"" counted Moreau.  ""There are four more.""
159	
159	""I do not see the Leopard-man,"" said I.
159	
159	Presently Moreau sounded the great horn again, and at the sound
159	of it all the Beast People writhed and grovelled in the dust.
159	Then, slinking out of the canebrake, stooping near the ground
159	and trying to join the dust-throwing circle behind Moreau's back,
159	came the Leopard-man. The last of the Beast People to arrive was the little
159	Ape-man. The earlier animals, hot and weary with their grovelling,
159	shot vicious glances at him.
159	
159	""Cease!"" said Moreau, in his firm, loud voice; and the Beast People
159	sat back upon their hams and rested from their worshipping.
159	
159	""Where is the Sayer of the Law?"" said Moreau, and the hairy-grey
159	monster bowed his face in the dust.
159	
159	""Say the words!"" said Moreau.
159	
159	Forthwith all in the kneeling assembly, swaying from side to side
159	and dashing up the sulphur with their hands,--first the right hand
159	and a puff of dust, and then the left,--began once more to chant
159	their strange litany.  When they reached, ""Not to eat Flesh or Fish,
159	that is the Law,"" Moreau held up his lank white hand.
159	
159	""Stop!"" he cried, and there fell absolute silence upon them all.
159	
159	I think they all knew and dreaded what was coming.
159	I looked round at their strange faces.  When I saw their wincing
159	attitudes and the furtive dread in their bright eyes, I wondered
159	that I had ever believed them to be men.
159	
159	""That Law has been broken!"" said Moreau.
159	
159	""None escape,"" from the faceless creature with the silvery hair.
159	""None escape,"" repeated the kneeling circle of Beast People.
159	
159	""Who is he?"" cried Moreau, and looked round at their faces,
159	cracking his whip.  I fancied the Hyena-swine looked dejected,
159	so too did the Leopard-man. Moreau stopped, facing this creature,
159	who cringed towards him with the memory and dread of infinite torment.
159	
159	""Who is he?"" repeated Moreau, in a voice of thunder.
159	
159	""Evil is he who breaks the Law,"" chanted the Sayer of the Law.
159	
159	Moreau looked into the eyes of the Leopard-man, and seemed to be
159	dragging the very soul out of the creature.
159	
159	""Who breaks the Law--"" said Moreau, taking his eyes off his victim,
159	and turning towards us (it seemed to me there was a touch of exultation
159	in his voice).
159	
159	""Goes back to the House of Pain,"" they all clamoured,--""goes back
159	to the House of Pain, O Master!""
159	
159	""Back to the House of Pain,--back to the House of Pain,""
159	gabbled the Ape-man, as though the idea was sweet to him.
159	
159	""Do you hear?"" said Moreau, turning back to the criminal,
159	""my friend--Hullo!""
159	
159	For the Leopard-man, released from Moreau's eye, had risen straight
159	from his knees, and now, with eyes aflame and his huge feline tusks
159	flashing out from under his curling lips, leapt towards his tormentor.
159	I am convinced that only the madness of unendurable fear could have
159	prompted this attack.  The whole circle of threescore monsters seemed
159	to rise about us.  I drew my revolver.  The two figures collided.
159	I saw Moreau reeling back from the Leopard-man's blow.  There was a
159	furious yelling and howling all about us.  Every one was moving rapidly.
159	For a moment I thought it was a general revolt.  The furious face
159	of the Leopard-man flashed by mine, with M'ling close in pursuit.
159	I saw the yellow eyes of the Hyena-swine blazing with excitement,
159	his attitude as if he were half resolved to attack me.
159	The Satyr, too, glared at me over the Hyena-swine's hunched shoulders.
159	I heard the crack of Moreau's pistol, and saw the pink flash
159	dart across the tumult.  The whole crowd seemed to swing round
159	in the direction of the glint of fire, and I too was swung round
159	by the magnetism of the movement.  In another second I was running,
159	one of a tumultuous shouting crowd, in pursuit of the escaping
159	Leopard-man.
159	
159	That is all I can tell definitely.  I saw the Leopard-man strike Moreau,
159	and then everything spun about me until I was running headlong.
159	M'ling was ahead, close in pursuit of the fugitive.  Behind, their tongues
159	already lolling out, ran the Wolf-women in great leaping strides.
159	The Swine folk followed, squealing with excitement, and the two
159	Bull-men in their swathings of white.  Then came Moreau in a
159	cluster of the Beast People, his wide-brimmed straw hat blown off,
159	his revolver in hand, and his lank white hair streaming out.
159	The Hyena-swine ran beside me, keeping pace with me and glancing furtively
159	at me out of his feline eyes, and the others came pattering and shouting
159	behind us.
159	
159	The Leopard-man went bursting his way through the long canes,
159	which sprang back as he passed, and rattled in M'ling's face.
159	We others in the rear found a trampled path for us when we reached
159	the brake.  The chase lay through the brake for perhaps a quarter
159	of a mile, and then plunged into a dense thicket, which retarded
159	our movements exceedingly, though we went through it in a crowd
159	together,--fronds flicking into our faces, ropy creepers catching
159	us under the chin or gripping our ankles, thorny plants hooking into
159	and tearing cloth and flesh together.
159	
159	""He has gone on all-fours through this,"" panted Moreau, now just
159	ahead of me.
159	
159	""None escape,"" said the Wolf-bear, laughing into my face with
159	the exultation of hunting.  We burst out again among rocks,
159	and saw the quarry ahead running lightly on all-fours and snarling
159	at us over his shoulder.  At that the Wolf Folk howled with delight.
159	The Thing was still clothed, and at a distance its face still seemed human;
159	but the carriage of its four limbs was feline, and the furtive
159	droop of its shoulder was distinctly that of a hunted animal.
159	It leapt over some thorny yellow-flowering bushes, and was hidden.
159	M'ling was halfway across the space.
159	
159	Most of us now had lost the first speed of the chase, and had fallen
159	into a longer and steadier stride.  I saw as we traversed the open
159	that the pursuit was now spreading from a column into a line.
159	The Hyena-swine still ran close to me, watching me as it ran,
159	every now and then puckering its muzzle with a snarling laugh.
159	At the edge of the rocks the Leopard-man, realising that he was
159	making for the projecting cape upon which he had stalked me
159	on the night of my arrival, had doubled in the undergrowth;
159	but Montgomery had seen the manoeuvre, and turned him again.
159	So, panting, tumbling against rocks, torn by brambles, impeded by
159	ferns and reeds, I helped to pursue the Leopard-man who had broken
159	the Law, and the Hyena-swine ran, laughing savagely, by my side.
159	I staggered on, my head reeling and my heart beating against my ribs,
159	tired almost to death, and yet not daring to lose sight of the chase
159	lest I should be left alone with this horrible companion.
159	I staggered on in spite of infinite fatigue and the dense heat of the
159	tropical afternoon.
159	
159	At last the fury of the hunt slackened.  We had pinned the wretched
159	brute into a corner of the island.  Moreau, whip in hand, marshalled us
159	all into an irregular line, and we advanced now slowly, shouting to one
159	another as we advanced and tightening the cordon about our victim.
159	He lurked noiseless and invisible in the bushes through which I
159	had run from him during that midnight pursuit.
159	
159	""Steady!"" cried Moreau, ""steady!"" as the ends of the line crept
159	round the tangle of undergrowth and hemmed the brute in.
159	
159	""Ware a rush!"" came the voice of Montgomery from beyond the thicket.
159	
159	I was on the slope above the bushes; Montgomery and Moreau beat
159	along the beach beneath.  Slowly we pushed in among the fretted
159	network of branches and leaves.  The quarry was silent.
159	
159	""Back to the House of Pain, the House of Pain, the House of Pain!""
159	yelped the voice of the Ape-man, some twenty yards to the right.
159	
159	When I heard that, I forgave the poor wretch all the fear he had
159	inspired in me.  I heard the twigs snap and the boughs swish aside
159	before the heavy tread of the Horse-rhinoceros upon my right.
159	Then suddenly through a polygon of green, in the half darkness
159	under the luxuriant growth, I saw the creature we were hunting.
159	I halted.  He was crouched together into the smallest possible compass,
159	his luminous green eyes turned over his shoulder regarding me.
159	
159	It may seem a strange contradiction in me,--I cannot explain the
159	fact,--but now, seeing the creature there in a perfectly animal
159	attitude, with the light gleaming in its eyes and its imperfectly
159	human face distorted with terror, I realised again the fact of its
159	humanity.  In another moment other of its pursuers would see it,
159	and it would be overpowered and captured, to experience once more
159	the horrible tortures of the enclosure.  Abruptly I slipped out
159	my revolver, aimed between its terror-struck eyes, and fired.
159	As I did so, the Hyena-swine saw the Thing, and flung itself upon
159	it with an eager cry, thrusting thirsty teeth into its neck.
159	All about me the green masses of the thicket were swaying and cracking
159	as the Beast People came rushing together.  One face and then
159	another appeared.
159	
159	""Don't kill it, Prendick!"" cried Moreau.  ""Don't kill it!""
159	and I saw him stooping as he pushed through under the fronds
159	of the big ferns.
159	
159	In another moment he had beaten off the Hyena-swine with the handle of
159	his whip, and he and Montgomery were keeping away the excited carnivorous
159	Beast People, and particularly M'ling, from the still quivering body.
159	The hairy-grey Thing came sniffing at the corpse under my arm.
159	The other animals, in their animal ardour, jostled me to get a
159	nearer view.
159	
159	""Confound you, Prendick!"" said Moreau.  ""I wanted him.""
159	
159	""I'm sorry,"" said I, though I was not.  ""It was the impulse
159	of the moment.""  I felt sick with exertion and excitement.
159	Turning, I pushed my way out of the crowding Beast People and went
159	on alone up the slope towards the higher part of the headland.
159	Under the shouted directions of Moreau I heard the three white-swathed
159	Bull-men begin dragging the victim down towards the water.
159	
159	It was easy now for me to be alone.  The Beast People manifested a quite
159	human curiosity about the dead body, and followed it in a thick knot,
159	sniffing and growling at it as the Bull-men dragged it down the beach.
159	I went to the headland and watched the bull-men, black against
159	the evening sky as they carried the weighted dead body out to sea;
159	and like a wave across my mind came the realisation of the unspeakable
159	aimlessness of things upon the island.  Upon the beach among
159	the rocks beneath me were the Ape-man, the Hyena-swine, and several
159	other of the Beast People, standing about Montgomery and Moreau.
159	They were all still intensely excited, and all overflowing with noisy
159	expressions of their loyalty to the Law; yet I felt an absolute
159	assurance in my own mind that the Hyena-swine was implicated
159	in the rabbit-killing. A strange persuasion came upon me, that,
159	save for the grossness of the line, the grotesqueness of the forms,
159	I had here before me the whole balance of human life in miniature,
159	the whole interplay of instinct, reason, and fate in its simplest form.
159	The Leopard-man had happened to go under:  that was all the difference.
159	Poor brute!
159	
159	Poor brutes!  I began to see the viler aspect of Moreau's cruelty.
159	I had not thought before of the pain and trouble that came
159	to these poor victims after they had passed from Moreau's hands.
159	I had shivered only at the days of actual torment in the enclosure.
159	But now that seemed to me the lesser part.  Before, they had
159	been beasts, their instincts fitly adapted to their surroundings,
159	and happy as living things may be.  Now they stumbled in the shackles
159	of humanity, lived in a fear that never died, fretted by a law they
159	could not understand; their mock-human existence, begun in an agony,
159	was one long internal struggle, one long dread of Moreau--and for what?
159	It was the wantonness of it that stirred me.
159	
159	Had Moreau had any intelligible object, I could have sympathised at
159	least a little with him.  I am not so squeamish about pain as that.
159	I could have forgiven him a little even, had his motive been only hate.
159	But he was so irresponsible, so utterly careless!  His curiosity,
159	his mad, aimless investigations, drove him on; and the Things were
159	thrown out to live a year or so, to struggle and blunder and suffer,
159	and at last to die painfully.  They were wretched in themselves;
159	the old animal hate moved them to trouble one another; the Law held
159	them back from a brief hot struggle and a decisive end to their
159	natural animosities.
159	
159	In those days my fear of the Beast People went the way of my personal
159	fear for Moreau.  I fell indeed into a morbid state, deep and enduring,
159	and alien to fear, which has left permanent scars upon my mind.
159	I must confess that I lost faith in the sanity of the world
159	when I saw it suffering the painful disorder of this island.
159	A blind Fate, a vast pitiless mechanism, seemed to cut and
159	shape the fabric of existence and I, Moreau (by his passion
159	for research), Montgomery (by his passion for drink), the Beast
159	People with their instincts and mental restrictions, were torn
159	and crushed, ruthlessly, inevitably, amid the infinite complexity
159	of its incessant wheels.  But this condition did not come all at once:
159	I think indeed that I anticipate a little in speaking of
159	it now.
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	XVII.  A CATASTROPHE.
159	
159	
159	SCARCELY six weeks passed before I had lost every feeling but
159	dislike and abhorrence for this infamous experiment of Moreau's.
159	My one idea was to get away from these horrible caricatures of my
159	Maker's image, back to the sweet and wholesome intercourse of men.
159	My fellow-creatures, from whom I was thus separated, began to assume
159	idyllic virtue and beauty in my memory.  My first friendship with
159	Montgomery did not increase.  His long separation from humanity,
159	his secret vice of drunkenness, his evident sympathy with the Beast People,
159	tainted him to me.  Several times I let him go alone among them.
159	I avoided intercourse with them in every possible way.
159	I spent an increasing proportion of my time upon the beach,
159	looking for some liberating sail that never appeared,--until one day
159	there fell upon us an appalling disaster, which put an altogether
159	different aspect upon my strange surroundings.
159	
159	It was about seven or eight weeks after my landing,--rather more,
159	I think, though I had not troubled to keep account of the time,--when
159	this catastrophe occurred.  It happened in the early morning--I
159	should think about six.  I had risen and breakfasted early, having
159	been aroused by the noise of three Beast Men carrying wood into the
159	enclosure.
159	
159	After breakfast I went to the open gateway of the enclosure,
159	and stood there smoking a cigarette and enjoying the freshness
159	of the early morning.  Moreau presently came round the corner
159	of the enclosure and greeted me.  He passed by me, and I heard him
159	behind me unlock and enter his laboratory.  So indurated was I
159	at that time to the abomination of the place, that I heard without
159	a touch of emotion the puma victim begin another day of torture.
159	It met its persecutor with a shriek, almost exactly like that of an
159	angry virago.
159	
159	Then suddenly something happened,--I do not know what,
159	to this day.  I heard a short, sharp cry behind me, a fall,
159	and turning saw an awful face rushing upon me,--not human,
159	not animal, but hellish, brown, seamed with red branching scars,
159	red drops starting out upon it, and the lidless eyes ablaze.
159	I threw up my arm to defend myself from the blow that flung
159	me headlong with a broken forearm; and the great monster,
159	swathed in lint and with red-stained bandages fluttering about it,
159	leapt over me and passed.  I rolled over and over down the beach,
159	tried to sit up, and collapsed upon my broken arm.  Then Moreau appeared,
159	his massive white face all the more terrible for the blood that
159	trickled from his forehead.  He carried a revolver in one hand.
159	He scarcely glanced at me, but rushed off at once in pursuit of
159	the puma.
159	
159	I tried the other arm and sat up.  The muffled figure in front ran
159	in great striding leaps along the beach, and Moreau followed her.
159	She turned her head and saw him, then doubling abruptly made
159	for the bushes.  She gained upon him at every stride.  I saw her
159	plunge into them, and Moreau, running slantingly to intercept her,
159	fired and missed as she disappeared.  Then he too vanished
159	in the green confusion.  I stared after them, and then the pain
159	in my arm flamed up, and with a groan I staggered to my feet.
159	Montgomery appeared in the doorway, dressed, and with his revolver in
159	his hand.
159	
159	""Great God, Prendick!"" he said, not noticing that I was hurt,
159	""that brute's loose!  Tore the fetter out of the wall!
159	Have you seen them?""  Then sharply, seeing I gripped my arm,
159	""What's the matter?""
159	
159	""I was standing in the doorway,"" said I.
159	
159	He came forward and took my arm.  ""Blood on the sleeve,""
159	said he, and rolled back the flannel.  He pocketed his weapon,
159	felt my arm about painfully, and led me inside.  ""Your arm
159	is broken,"" he said, and then, ""Tell me exactly how it
159	happened--what happened?""
159	
159	I told him what I had seen; told him in broken sentences,
159	with gasps of pain between them, and very dexterously and swiftly
159	he bound my arm meanwhile.  He slung it from my shoulder,
159	stood back and looked at me.
159	
159	""You'll do,"" he said.  ""And now?""
159	
159	He thought.  Then he went out and locked the gates of the enclosure.
159	He was absent some time.
159	
159	I was chiefly concerned about my arm.  The incident seemed merely
159	one more of many horrible things.  I sat down in the deck chair,
159	and I must admit swore heartily at the island.  The first dull
159	feeling of injury in my arm had already given way to a burning pain
159	when Montgomery reappeared.  His face was rather pale, and he showed
159	more of his lower gums than ever.
159	
159	""I can neither see nor hear anything of him,"" he said.
159	""I've been thinking he may want my help.""  He stared at me with
159	his expressionless eyes.  ""That was a strong brute,"" he said.
159	""It simply wrenched its fetter out of the wall.""  He went to the window,
159	then to the door, and there turned to me.  ""I shall go after him,""
159	he said.  ""There's another revolver I can leave with you.
159	To tell you the truth, I feel anxious somehow.""
159	
159	He obtained the weapon, and put it ready to my hand on the table;
159	then went out, leaving a restless contagion in the air.
159	I did not sit long after he left, but took the revolver in hand and went
159	to the doorway.
159	
159	The morning was as still as death.  Not a whisper of wind was stirring;
159	the sea was like polished glass, the sky empty, the beach desolate.
159	In my half-excited, half-feverish state, this stillness of things
159	oppressed me.  I tried to whistle, and the tune died away.
159	I swore again,--the second time that morning.  Then I went to the corner
159	of the enclosure and stared inland at the green bush that had
159	swallowed up Moreau and Montgomery.  When would they return, and how?
159	Then far away up the beach a little grey Beast Man appeared,
159	ran down to the water's edge and began splashing about.
159	I strolled back to the doorway, then to the corner again,
159	and so began pacing to and fro like a sentinel upon duty.
159	Once I was arrested by the distant voice of Montgomery bawling,
159	""Coo-ee--Moreau!""  My arm became less painful, but very hot.
159	I got feverish and thirsty.  My shadow grew shorter.
159	I watched the distant figure until it went away again.  Would Moreau
159	and Montgomery never return?  Three sea-birds began fighting for some
159	stranded treasure.
159	
159	Then from far away behind the enclosure I heard a pistol-shot. A
159	long silence, and then came another.  Then a yelling cry nearer,
159	and another dismal gap of silence.  My unfortunate imagination
159	set to work to torment me.  Then suddenly a shot close by.
159	I went to the corner, startled, and saw Montgomery,--his face scarlet,
159	his hair disordered, and the knee of his trousers torn.
159	His face expressed profound consternation.  Behind him slouched
159	the Beast Man, M'ling, and round M'ling's jaws were some queer
159	dark stains.
159	
159	""Has he come?"" said Montgomery.
159	
159	""Moreau?"" said I. ""No.""
159	
159	""My God!""  The man was panting, almost sobbing.  ""Go back in,"" he said,
159	taking my arm.  ""They're mad.  They're all rushing about mad.  What can
159	have happened?  I don't know.  I'll tell you, when my breath comes.
159	Where's some brandy?""
159	
159	Montgomery limped before me into the room and sat down in the deck chair.
159	M'ling flung himself down just outside the doorway and began
159	panting like a dog.  I got Montgomery some brandy-and-water. He
159	sat staring in front of him at nothing, recovering his breath.
159	After some minutes he began to tell me what had happened.
159	
159	He had followed their track for some way.  It was plain enough at
159	first on account of the crushed and broken bushes, white rags torn
159	from the puma's bandages, and occasional smears of blood on the leaves
159	of the shrubs and undergrowth.  He lost the track, however, on the stony
159	ground beyond the stream where I had seen the Beast Man drinking,
159	and went wandering aimlessly westward shouting Moreau's name.
159	Then M'ling had come to him carrying a light hatchet.  M'ling had seen
159	nothing of the puma affair; had been felling wood, and heard him calling.
159	They went on shouting together.  Two Beast Men came crouching
159	and peering at them through the undergrowth, with gestures and a
159	furtive carriage that alarmed Montgomery by their strangeness.
159	He hailed them, and they fled guiltily.  He stopped shouting
159	after that, and after wandering some time farther in an undecided way,
159	determined to visit the huts.
159	
159	He found the ravine deserted.
159	
159	Growing more alarmed every minute, he began to retrace his steps.
159	Then it was he encountered the two Swine-men I had seen dancing
159	on the night of my arrival; blood-stained they were about the mouth,
159	and intensely excited.  They came crashing through the ferns,
159	and stopped with fierce faces when they saw him.  He cracked his whip
159	in some trepidation, and forthwith they rushed at him.  Never before
159	had a Beast Man dared to do that.  One he shot through the head;
159	M'ling flung himself upon the other, and the two rolled grappling.
159	M'ling got his brute under and with his teeth in its throat,
159	and Montgomery shot that too as it struggled in M'ling's grip.
159	He had some difficulty in inducing M'ling to come on with him.
159	Thence they had hurried back to me.  On the way, M'ling had suddenly
159	rushed into a thicket and driven out an under-sized Ocelot-man,
159	also blood-stained, and lame through a wound in the foot.
159	This brute had run a little way and then turned savagely at bay,
159	and Montgomery--with a certain wantonness, I thought--had shot
159	him.
159	
159	""What does it all mean?"" said I.
159	
159	He shook his head, and turned once more to the brandy.
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	XVIII.  THE FINDING OF MOREAU.
159	
159	
159	WHEN I saw Montgomery swallow a third dose of brandy, I took it
159	upon myself to interfere.  He was already more than half fuddled.
159	I told him that some serious thing must have happened to
159	Moreau by this time, or he would have returned before this,
159	and that it behoved us to ascertain what that catastrophe was.
159	Montgomery raised some feeble objections, and at last agreed.
159	We had some food, and then all three of us started.
159	
159	It is possibly due to the tension of my mind, at the time,
159	but even now that start into the hot stillness of the tropical
159	afternoon is a singularly vivid impression.  M'ling went first,
159	his shoulder hunched, his strange black head moving with quick
159	starts as he peered first on this side of the way and then on that.
159	He was unarmed; his axe he had dropped when he encountered
159	the Swine-man. Teeth were _his_ weapons, when it came to fighting.
159	Montgomery followed with stumbling footsteps, his hands in his pockets,
159	his face downcast; he was in a state of muddled sullenness
159	with me on account of the brandy.  My left arm was in a sling
159	(it was lucky it was my left), and I carried my revolver in my right.
159	Soon we traced a narrow path through the wild luxuriance of
159	the island, going northwestward; and presently M'ling stopped,
159	and became rigid with watchfulness.  Montgomery almost staggered
159	into him, and then stopped too.  Then, listening intently,
159	we heard coming through the trees the sound of voices and footsteps
159	approaching us.
159	
159	""He is dead,"" said a deep, vibrating voice.
159	
159	""He is not dead; he is not dead,"" jabbered another.
159	
159	""We saw, we saw,"" said several voices.
159	
159	""Hullo!"" suddenly shouted Montgomery, ""Hullo, there!""
159	
159	""Confound you!"" said I, and gripped my pistol.
159	
159	There was a silence, then a crashing among the interlacing vegetation,
159	first here, then there, and then half-a-dozen faces appeared,--strange
159	faces, lit by a strange light.  M'ling made a growling
159	noise in his throat.  I recognised the Ape-man: I had indeed
159	already identified his voice, and two of the white-swathed
159	brown-featured creatures I had seen in Montgomery's boat.
159	With these were the two dappled brutes and that grey, horribly crooked
159	creature who said the Law, with grey hair streaming down its cheeks,
159	heavy grey eyebrows, and grey locks pouring off from a central
159	parting upon its sloping forehead,--a heavy, faceless thing,
159	with strange red eyes, looking at us curiously from amidst
159	the green.
159	
159	For a space no one spoke.  Then Montgomery hiccoughed, ""Who--said
159	he was dead?""
159	
159	The Monkey-man looked guiltily at the hairy-grey Thing.  ""He is dead,""
159	said this monster.  ""They saw.""
159	
159	There was nothing threatening about this detachment, at any rate.
159	They seemed awestricken and puzzled.
159	
159	""Where is he?"" said Montgomery.
159	
159	""Beyond,"" and the grey creature pointed.
159	
159	""Is there a Law now?"" asked the Monkey-man. ""Is it still to be this
159	and that?  Is he dead indeed?""
159	
159	""Is there a Law?"" repeated the man in white.  ""Is there a Law,
159	thou Other with the Whip?""
159	
159	""He is dead,"" said the hairy-grey Thing.  And they all stood
159	watching us.
159	
159	""Prendick,"" said Montgomery, turning his dull eyes to me.
159	""He's dead, evidently.""
159	
159	I had been standing behind him during this colloquy.
159	I began to see how things lay with them.  I suddenly stepped in front
159	of Montgomery and lifted up my voice:--""Children of the Law,""
159	I said, ""he is _not_ dead!""  M'ling turned his sharp eyes on me.
159	""He has changed his shape; he has changed his body,"" I went on.
159	""For a time you will not see him.  He is--there,"" I pointed upward,
159	""where he can watch you.  You cannot see him, but he can see you.
159	Fear the Law!""
159	
159	I looked at them squarely.  They flinched.
159	
159	""He is great, he is good,"" said the Ape-man, peering fearfully
159	upward among the dense trees.
159	
159	""And the other Thing?""  I demanded.
159	
159	""The Thing that bled, and ran screaming and sobbing,--that is dead too,""
159	said the grey Thing, still regarding me.
159	
159	""That's well,"" grunted Montgomery.
159	
159	""The Other with the Whip--"" began the grey Thing.
159	
159	""Well?"" said I.
159	
159	""Said he was dead.""
159	
159	But Montgomery was still sober enough to understand my motive in denying
159	Moreau's death.  ""He is not dead,"" he said slowly, ""not dead at all.
159	No more dead than I am.""
159	
159	""Some,"" said I, ""have broken the Law:  they will die.  Some have died.
159	Show us now where his old body lies,--the body he cast away because
159	he had no more need of it.""
159	
159	""It is this way, Man who walked in the Sea,"" said the grey Thing.
159	
159	And with these six creatures guiding us, we went through the tumult
159	of ferns and creepers and tree-stems towards the northwest.
159	Then came a yelling, a crashing among the branches, and a little
159	pink homunculus rushed by us shrieking.  Immediately after appeared
159	a monster in headlong pursuit, blood-bedabbled, who was amongst us
159	almost before he could stop his career.  The grey Thing leapt aside.
159	M'ling, with a snarl, flew at it, and was struck aside.  Montgomery fired
159	and missed, bowed his head, threw up his arm, and turned to run.
159	I fired, and the Thing still came on; fired again, point-blank, into
159	its ugly face.  I saw its features vanish in a flash:  its face was
159	driven in.  Yet it passed me, gripped Montgomery, and holding him,
159	fell headlong beside him and pulled him sprawling upon itself in its
159	death-agony.
159	
159	I found myself alone with M'ling, the dead brute, and the prostrate man.
159	Montgomery raised himself slowly and stared in a muddled way at
159	the shattered Beast Man beside him.  It more than half sobered him.
159	He scrambled to his feet.  Then I saw the grey Thing returning cautiously
159	through the trees.
159	
159	""See,"" said I, pointing to the dead brute, ""is the Law not alive?
159	This came of breaking the Law.""
159	
159	He peered at the body.  ""He sends the Fire that kills,""
159	said he, in his deep voice, repeating part of the Ritual.
159	The others gathered round and stared for a space.
159	
159	At last we drew near the westward extremity of the island.
159	We came upon the gnawed and mutilated body of the puma,
159	its shoulder-bone smashed by a bullet, and perhaps twenty yards
159	farther found at last what we sought.  Moreau lay face downward
159	in a trampled space in a canebrake.  One hand was almost severed
159	at the wrist and his silvery hair was dabbled in blood.
159	His head had been battered in by the fetters of the puma.
159	The broken canes beneath him were smeared with blood.
159	His revolver we could not find.  Montgomery turned him over.
159	Resting at intervals, and with the help of the seven Beast People
159	(for he was a heavy man), we carried Moreau back to the enclosure.
159	The night was darkling.  Twice we heard unseen creatures howling
159	and shrieking past our little band, and once the little pink
159	sloth-creature appeared and stared at us, and vanished again.
159	But we were not attacked again.  At the gates of the enclosure
159	our company of Beast People left us, M'ling going with the rest.
159	We locked ourselves in, and then took Moreau's mangled
159	body into the yard and laid it upon a pile of brushwood.
159	Then we went into the laboratory and put an end to all we found living
159	there.
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	XIX.  MONTGOMERY'S ""BANK HOLIDAY.""
159	
159	
159	WHEN this was accomplished, and we had washed and eaten,
159	Montgomery and I went into my little room and seriously discussed
159	our position for the first time.  It was then near midnight.
159	He was almost sober, but greatly disturbed in his mind.
159	He had been strangely under the influence of Moreau's personality:
159	I do not think it had ever occurred to him that Moreau could die.
159	This disaster was the sudden collapse of the habits that had become part of
159	his nature in the ten or more monotonous years he had spent on the island.
159	He talked vaguely, answered my questions crookedly, wandered into
159	general questions.
159	
159	""This silly ass of a world,"" he said; ""what a muddle it all is!
159	I haven't had any life.  I wonder when it's going to begin.
159	Sixteen years being bullied by nurses and schoolmasters at
159	their own sweet will; five in London grinding hard at medicine,
159	bad food, shabby lodgings, shabby clothes, shabby vice, a blunder,--I
159	didn't know any better,--and hustled off to this beastly island.
159	Ten years here!  What's it all for, Prendick?  Are we bubbles blown by
159	a baby?""
159	
159	It was hard to deal with such ravings.  ""The thing we have to think
159	of now,"" said I, ""is how to get away from this island.""
159	
159	""What's the good of getting away?  I'm an outcast.
159	Where am _I_ to join on?  It's all very well for _you_, Prendick.
159	Poor old Moreau!  We can't leave him here to have his bones picked.
159	As it is--And besides, what will become of the decent part of the
159	Beast Folk?""
159	
159	""Well,"" said I, ""that will do to-morrow. I've been thinking we might make
159	the brushwood into a pyre and burn his body--and those other things.
159	Then what will happen with the Beast Folk?""
159	
159	""_I_ don't know.  I suppose those that were made of beasts of prey will
159	make silly asses of themselves sooner or later.  We can't massacre
159	the lot--can we?  I suppose that's what _your_ humanity would suggest?
159	But they'll change.  They are sure to change.""
159	
159	He talked thus inconclusively until at last I felt my temper going.
159	
159	""Damnation!"" he exclaimed at some petulance of mine; ""can't you see I'm
159	in a worse hole than you are?""  And he got up, and went for the brandy.
159	""Drink!"" he said returning, ""you logic-chopping, chalky-faced saint
159	of an atheist, drink!""
159	
159	""Not I,"" said I, and sat grimly watching his face under the yellow
159	paraffine flare, as he drank himself into a garrulous misery.
159	
159	I have a memory of infinite tedium.  He wandered into a maudlin
159	defence of the Beast People and of M'ling. M'ling, he said,
159	was the only thing that had ever really cared for him.
159	And suddenly an idea came to him.
159	
159	""I'm damned!"" said he, staggering to his feet and clutching
159	the brandy bottle.
159	
159	By some flash of intuition I knew what it was he intended.
159	""You don't give drink to that beast!""  I said, rising and facing him.
159	
159	""Beast!"" said he.  ""You're the beast.  He takes his liquor
159	like a Christian.  Come out of the way, Prendick!""
159	
159	""For God's sake,"" said I.
159	
159	""Get--out of the way!"" he roared, and suddenly whipped out his revolver.
159	
159	""Very well,"" said I, and stood aside, half-minded to fall upon him
159	as he put his hand upon the latch, but deterred by the thought
159	of my useless arm.  ""You've made a beast of yourself,--to the beasts
159	you may go.""
159	
159	He flung the doorway open, and stood half facing me between
159	the yellow lamp-light and the pallid glare of the moon;
159	his eye-sockets were blotches of black under his stubbly eyebrows.
159	
159	""You're a solemn prig, Prendick, a silly ass!  You're always fearing
159	and fancying.  We're on the edge of things.  I'm bound to cut my
159	throat to-morrow. I'm going to have a damned Bank Holiday to-night.""
159	He turned and went out into the moonlight.  ""M'ling!"" he cried;
159	""M'ling, old friend!""
159	
159	Three dim creatures in the silvery light came along the edge
159	of the wan beach,--one a white-wrapped creature, the other two
159	blotches of blackness following it.  They halted, staring.
159	Then I saw M'ling's hunched shoulders as he came round the corner
159	of the house.
159	
159	""Drink!"" cried Montgomery, ""drink, you brutes!  Drink and be men!
159	Damme, I'm the cleverest.  Moreau forgot this; this is the last touch.
159	Drink, I tell you!""  And waving the bottle in his hand he started
159	off at a kind of quick trot to the westward, M'ling ranging himself
159	between him and the three dim creatures who followed.
159	
159	I went to the doorway.  They were already indistinct in the mist
159	of the moonlight before Montgomery halted.  I saw him administer
159	a dose of the raw brandy to M'ling, and saw the five figures melt
159	into one vague patch.
159	
159	""Sing!""  I heard Montgomery shout,--""sing all together, 'Confound
159	old Prendick!'  That's right; now again, 'Confound old Prendick!'""
159	
159	The black group broke up into five separate figures,
159	and wound slowly away from me along the band of shining beach.
159	Each went howling at his own sweet will, yelping insults at me,
159	or giving whatever other vent this new inspiration of brandy demanded.
159	Presently I heard Montgomery's voice shouting, ""Right turn!""
159	and they passed with their shouts and howls into the blackness
159	of the landward trees.  Slowly, very slowly, they receded
159	into silence.
159	
159	The peaceful splendour of the night healed again.
159	The moon was now past the meridian and travelling down the west.
159	It was at its full, and very bright riding through the empty blue sky.
159	The shadow of the wall lay, a yard wide and of inky blackness, at my feet.
159	The eastward sea was a featureless grey, dark and mysterious;
159	and between the sea and the shadow the grey sands (of volcanic
159	glass and crystals) flashed and shone like a beach of diamonds.
159	Behind me the paraffine lamp flared hot and ruddy.
159	
159	Then I shut the door, locked it, and went into the enclosure where
159	Moreau lay beside his latest victims,--the staghounds and the llama
159	and some other wretched brutes,--with his massive face calm even
159	after his terrible death, and with the hard eyes open, staring at
159	the dead white moon above.  I sat down upon the edge of the sink,
159	and with my eyes upon that ghastly pile of silvery light and ominous
159	shadows began to turn over my plans.  In the morning I would gather
159	some provisions in the dingey, and after setting fire to the pyre
159	before me, push out into the desolation of the high sea once more.
159	I felt that for Montgomery there was no help; that he was, in truth,
159	half akin to these Beast Folk, unfitted for human kindred.
159	
159	I do not know how long I sat there scheming.  It must have been
159	an hour or so.  Then my planning was interrupted by the return of
159	Montgomery to my neighbourhood.  I heard a yelling from many throats,
159	a tumult of exultant cries passing down towards the beach,
159	whooping and howling, and excited shrieks that seemed to come to a stop
159	near the water's edge.  The riot rose and fell; I heard heavy blows
159	and the splintering smash of wood, but it did not trouble me then.
159	A discordant chanting began.
159	
159	My thoughts went back to my means of escape.  I got up, brought the lamp,
159	and went into a shed to look at some kegs I had seen there.
159	Then I became interested in the contents of some biscuit-tins, and
159	opened one.  I saw something out of the tail of my eye,--a red
159	figure,--and turned sharply.
159	
159	Behind me lay the yard, vividly black-and-white in the moonlight,
159	and the pile of wood and faggots on which Moreau and his mutilated
159	victims lay, one over another.  They seemed to be gripping one another
159	in one last revengeful grapple.  His wounds gaped, black as night,
159	and the blood that had dripped lay in black patches upon the sand.
159	Then I saw, without understanding, the cause of my phantom,--a
159	ruddy glow that came and danced and went upon the wall opposite.
159	I misinterpreted this, fancied it was a reflection of my
159	flickering lamp, and turned again to the stores in the shed.
159	I went on rummaging among them, as well as a one-armed man could,
159	finding this convenient thing and that, and putting them
159	aside for to-morrow's launch.  My movements were slow,
159	and the time passed quickly.  Insensibly the daylight crept
159	upon me.
159	
159	The chanting died down, giving place to a clamour; then it
159	began again, and suddenly broke into a tumult.  I heard cries of,
159	""More! more!"" a sound like quarrelling, and a sudden wild shriek.
159	The quality of the sounds changed so greatly that it arrested
159	my attention.  I went out into the yard and listened.
159	Then cutting like a knife across the confusion came the crack of
159	a revolver.
159	
159	I rushed at once through my room to the little doorway.
159	As I did so I heard some of the packing-cases behind me go sliding down
159	and smash together with a clatter of glass on the floor of the shed.
159	But I did not heed these.  I flung the door open and looked out.
159	
159	Up the beach by the boathouse a bonfire was burning, raining up
159	sparks into the indistinctness of the dawn.  Around this struggled
159	a mass of black figures.  I heard Montgomery call my name.
159	I began to run at once towards this fire, revolver in hand.  I saw the pink
159	tongue of Montgomery's pistol lick out once, close to the ground.
159	He was down.  I shouted with all my strength and fired into the air.
159	I heard some one cry, ""The Master!""  The knotted black struggle
159	broke into scattering units, the fire leapt and sank down.
159	The crowd of Beast People fled in sudden panic before me, up the beach.
159	In my excitement I fired at their retreating backs as they
159	disappeared among the bushes.  Then I turned to the black heaps upon
159	the ground.
159	
159	Montgomery lay on his back, with the hairy-grey Beast-man
159	sprawling across his body.  The brute was dead, but still
159	gripping Montgomery's throat with its curving claws.
159	Near by lay M'ling on his face and quite still, his neck bitten
159	open and the upper part of the smashed brandy-bottle in his hand.
159	Two other figures lay near the fire,--the one motionless, the other
159	groaning fitfully, every now and then raising its head slowly,
159	then dropping it again.
159	
159	I caught hold of the grey man and pulled him off Montgomery's body;
159	his claws drew down the torn coat reluctantly as I dragged him away.
159	Montgomery was dark in the face and scarcely breathing.  I splashed
159	sea-water on his face and pillowed his head on my rolled-up coat.
159	M'ling was dead.  The wounded creature by the fire--it was a Wolf-brute
159	with a bearded grey face--lay, I found, with the fore part of its
159	body upon the still glowing timber.  The wretched thing was injured
159	so dreadfully that in mercy I blew its brains out at once.
159	The other brute was one of the Bull-men swathed in white.
159	He too was dead.  The rest of the Beast People had vanished from
159	the beach.
159	
159	I went to Montgomery again and knelt beside him, cursing my ignorance
159	of medicine.  The fire beside me had sunk down, and only charred
159	beams of timber glowing at the central ends and mixed with a grey
159	ash of brushwood remained.  I wondered casually where Montgomery
159	had got his wood.  Then I saw that the dawn was upon us.
159	The sky had grown brighter, the setting moon was becoming pale
159	and opaque in the luminous blue of the day.  The sky to the eastward
159	was rimmed with red.
159	
159	Suddenly I heard a thud and a hissing behind me, and, looking round,
159	sprang to my feet with a cry of horror.  Against the warm dawn
159	great tumultuous masses of black smoke were boiling up out of
159	the enclosure, and through their stormy darkness shot flickering
159	threads of blood-red flame.  Then the thatched roof caught.
159	I saw the curving charge of the flames across the sloping straw.
159	A spurt of fire jetted from the window of my room.
159	
159	I knew at once what had happened.  I remembered the crash I had heard.
159	When I had rushed out to Montgomery's assistance, I had overturned
159	the lamp.
159	
159	The hopelessness of saving any of the contents of the enclosure
159	stared me in the face.  My mind came back to my plan of flight,
159	and turning swiftly I looked to see where the two boats lay upon
159	the beach.  They were gone!  Two axes lay upon the sands beside me;
159	chips and splinters were scattered broadcast, and the ashes
159	of the bonfire were blackening and smoking under the dawn.
159	Montgomery had burnt the boats to revenge himself upon me and prevent our
159	return to mankind!
159	
159	A sudden convulsion of rage shook me.  I was almost moved to batter
159	his foolish head in, as he lay there helpless at my feet.
159	Then suddenly his hand moved, so feebly, so pitifully, that my
159	wrath vanished.  He groaned, and opened his eyes for a minute.
159	I knelt down beside him and raised his head.  He opened his
159	eyes again, staring silently at the dawn, and then they met mine.
159	The lids fell.
159	
159	""Sorry,"" he said presently, with an effort.  He seemed trying to think.
159	""The last,"" he murmured, ""the last of this silly universe.
159	What a mess--""
159	
159	I listened.  His head fell helplessly to one side.  I thought some drink
159	might revive him; but there was neither drink nor vessel in which to
159	bring drink at hand.  He seemed suddenly heavier.  My heart went cold.
159	I bent down to his face, put my hand through the rent in his blouse.
159	He was dead; and even as he died a line of white heat, the limb
159	of the sun, rose eastward beyond the projection of the bay,
159	splashing its radiance across the sky and turning the dark sea into
159	a weltering tumult of dazzling light.  It fell like a glory upon his
159	death-shrunken face.
159	
159	I let his head fall gently upon the rough pillow I had made for him,
159	and stood up.  Before me was the glittering desolation of the sea,
159	the awful solitude upon which I had already suffered so much; behind me
159	the island, hushed under the dawn, its Beast People silent and unseen.
159	The enclosure, with all its provisions and ammunition, burnt noisily,
159	with sudden gusts of flame, a fitful crackling, and now and then a crash.
159	The heavy smoke drove up the beach away from me, rolling low
159	over the distant tree-tops towards the huts in the ravine.
159	Beside me were the charred vestiges of the boats and these five
159	dead bodies.
159	
159	Then out of the bushes came three Beast People, with hunched shoulders,
159	protruding heads, misshapen hands awkwardly held, and inquisitive,
159	unfriendly eyes and advanced towards me with hesitating gestures.
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	XX.  ALONE WITH THE BEAST FOLK.
159	
159	
159	I FACED these people, facing my fate in them, single-handed
159	now,--literally single-handed, for I had a broken arm.  In my pocket was
159	a revolver with two empty chambers.  Among the chips scattered about
159	the beach lay the two axes that had been used to chop up the boats.
159	The tide was creeping in behind me.  There was nothing for it but
159	courage.  I looked squarely into the faces of the advancing monsters.
159	They avoided my eyes, and their quivering nostrils investigated
159	the bodies that lay beyond me on the beach.  I took half-a-dozen steps,
159	picked up the blood-stained whip that lay beneath the body
159	of the Wolf-man, and cracked it.  They stopped and stared
159	at me.
159	
159	""Salute!"" said I. ""Bow down!""
159	
159	They hesitated.  One bent his knees.  I repeated my command,
159	with my heart in my mouth, and advanced upon them.  One knelt,
159	then the other two.
159	
159	I turned and walked towards the dead bodies, keeping my face
159	towards the three kneeling Beast Men, very much as an actor passing
159	up the stage faces the audience.
159	
159	""They broke the Law,"" said I, putting my foot on the Sayer of the Law.
159	""They have been slain,--even the Sayer of the Law; even the Other with
159	the Whip.  Great is the Law!  Come and see.""
159	
159	""None escape,"" said one of them, advancing and peering.
159	
159	""None escape,"" said I. ""Therefore hear and do as I command.""
159	They stood up, looking questioningly at one another.
159	
159	""Stand there,"" said I.
159	
159	I picked up the hatchets and swung them by their heads from
159	the sling of my arm; turned Montgomery over; picked up his revolver
159	still loaded in two chambers, and bending down to rummage,
159	found half-a-dozen cartridges in his pocket.
159	
159	""Take him,"" said I, standing up again and pointing with the whip;
159	""take him, and carry him out and cast him into the sea.""
159	
159	They came forward, evidently still afraid of Montgomery,
159	but still more afraid of my cracking red whip-lash; and after
159	some fumbling and hesitation, some whip-cracking and shouting,
159	they lifted him gingerly, carried him down to the beach, and went
159	splashing into the dazzling welter of the sea.
159	
159	""On!"" said I, ""on!  Carry him far.""
159	
159	They went in up to their armpits and stood regarding me.
159	
159	""Let go,"" said I; and the body of Montgomery vanished with a splash.
159	Something seemed to tighten across my chest.
159	
159	""Good!"" said I, with a break in my voice; and they came back,
159	hurrying and fearful, to the margin of the water, leaving long
159	wakes of black in the silver.  At the water's edge they stopped,
159	turning and glaring into the sea as though they presently expected
159	Montgomery to arise therefrom and exact vengeance.
159	
159	""Now these,"" said I, pointing to the other bodies.
159	
159	They took care not to approach the place where they had thrown
159	Montgomery into the water, but instead, carried the four dead
159	Beast People slantingly along the beach for perhaps a hundred
159	yards before they waded out and cast them away.
159	
159	As I watched them disposing of the mangled remains of M'ling, I
159	heard a light footfall behind me, and turning quickly saw the big
159	Hyena-swine perhaps a dozen yards away.  His head was bent down,
159	his bright eyes were fixed upon me, his stumpy hands clenched
159	and held close by his side.  He stopped in this crouching attitude
159	when I turned, his eyes a little averted.
159	
159	For a moment we stood eye to eye.  I dropped the whip and snatched
159	at the pistol in my pocket; for I meant to kill this brute, the most
159	formidable of any left now upon the island, at the first excuse.
159	It may seem treacherous, but so I was resolved.  I was far
159	more afraid of him than of any other two of the Beast Folk.
159	His continued life was I knew a threat against mine.
159	
159	I was perhaps a dozen seconds collecting myself.  Then cried I, ""Salute!
159	Bow down!""
159	
159	His teeth flashed upon me in a snarl.  ""Who are _you_ that I should--""
159	
159	Perhaps a little too spasmodically I drew my revolver, aimed quickly
159	and fired.  I heard him yelp, saw him run sideways and turn, knew I
159	had missed, and clicked back the cock with my thumb for the next shot.
159	But he was already running headlong, jumping from side to side,
159	and I dared not risk another miss.  Every now and then he looked
159	back at me over his shoulder.  He went slanting along the beach,
159	and vanished beneath the driving masses of dense smoke that were
159	still pouring out from the burning enclosure.  For some time I
159	stood staring after him.  I turned to my three obedient Beast Folk
159	again and signalled them to drop the body they still carried.
159	Then I went back to the place by the fire where the bodies had fallen
159	and kicked the sand until all the brown blood-stains were absorbed
159	and hidden.
159	
159	I dismissed my three serfs with a wave of the hand, and went up
159	the beach into the thickets.  I carried my pistol in my hand,
159	my whip thrust with the hatchets in the sling of my arm.
159	I was anxious to be alone, to think out the position in which I
159	was now placed.  A dreadful thing that I was only beginning
159	to realise was, that over all this island there was now no safe
159	place where I could be alone and secure to rest or sleep.
159	I had recovered strength amazingly since my landing, but I was still
159	inclined to be nervous and to break down under any great stress.
159	I felt that I ought to cross the island and establish myself
159	with the Beast People, and make myself secure in their confidence.
159	But my heart failed me.  I went back to the beach, and turning
159	eastward past the burning enclosure, made for a point where a shallow
159	spit of coral sand ran out towards the reef.  Here I could sit down
159	and think, my back to the sea and my face against any surprise.
159	And there I sat, chin on knees, the sun beating down upon my head
159	and unspeakable dread in my mind, plotting how I could live on against
159	the hour of my rescue (if ever rescue came). I tried to review the whole
159	situation as calmly as I could, but it was difficult to clear the thing
159	of emotion.
159	
159	I began turning over in my mind the reason of Montgomery's despair.
159	""They will change,"" he said; ""they are sure to change.""  And Moreau,
159	what was it that Moreau had said?  ""The stubborn beast-flesh grows
159	day by day back again.""  Then I came round to the Hyena-swine. I
159	felt sure that if I did not kill that brute, he would kill me.
159	The Sayer of the Law was dead:  worse luck.  They knew now that we
159	of the Whips could be killed even as they themselves were killed.
159	Were they peering at me already out of the green masses of ferns
159	and palms over yonder, watching until I came within their spring?
159	Were they plotting against me?  What was the Hyena-swine telling them?
159	My imagination was running away with me into a morass of unsubstantial
159	fears.
159	
159	My thoughts were disturbed by a crying of sea-birds hurrying
159	towards some black object that had been stranded by the waves
159	on the beach near the enclosure.  I knew what that object was,
159	but I had not the heart to go back and drive them off.
159	I began walking along the beach in the opposite direction,
159	designing to come round the eastward corner of the island and so
159	approach the ravine of the huts, without traversing the possible
159	ambuscades of the thickets.
159	
159	Perhaps half a mile along the beach I became aware of one of my three
159	Beast Folk advancing out of the landward bushes towards me.  I was now
159	so nervous with my own imaginings that I immediately drew my revolver.
159	Even the propitiatory gestures of the creature failed to disarm me.
159	He hesitated as he approached.
159	
159	""Go away!"" cried I.
159	
159	There was something very suggestive of a dog in the cringing attitude
159	of the creature.  It retreated a little way, very like a dog being
159	sent home, and stopped, looking at me imploringly with canine
159	brown eyes.
159	
159	""Go away,"" said I. ""Do not come near me.""
159	
159	""May I not come near you?"" it said.
159	
159	""No; go away,"" I insisted, and snapped my whip.  Then putting
159	my whip in my teeth, I stooped for a stone, and with that threat
159	drove the creature away.
159	
159	So in solitude I came round by the ravine of the Beast People,
159	and hiding among the weeds and reeds that separated this
159	crevice from the sea I watched such of them as appeared,
159	trying to judge from their gestures and appearance how the death
159	of Moreau and Montgomery and the destruction of the House of Pain
159	had affected them.  I know now the folly of my cowardice.
159	Had I kept my courage up to the level of the dawn, had I not
159	allowed it to ebb away in solitary thought, I might have grasped
159	the vacant sceptre of Moreau and ruled over the Beast People.
159	As it was I lost the opportunity, and sank to the position of a mere
159	leader among my fellows.
159	
159	Towards noon certain of them came and squatted basking in the hot sand.
159	The imperious voices of hunger and thirst prevailed over my dread.
159	I came out of the bushes, and, revolver in hand, walked down towards
159	these seated figures.  One, a Wolf-woman, turned her head and stared
159	at me, and then the others.  None attempted to rise or salute me.
159	I felt too faint and weary to insist, and I let the moment pass.
159	
159	""I want food,"" said I, almost apologetically, and drawing near.
159	
159	""There is food in the huts,"" said an Ox-boar-man, drowsily,
159	and looking away from me.
159	
159	I passed them, and went down into the shadow and odours of the almost
159	deserted ravine.  In an empty hut I feasted on some specked
159	and half-decayed fruit; and then after I had propped some branches
159	and sticks about the opening, and placed myself with my face
159	towards it and my hand upon my revolver, the exhaustion of the last
159	thirty hours claimed its own, and I fell into a light slumber,
159	hoping that the flimsy barricade I had erected would cause
159	sufficient noise in its removal to save me from surprise.
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	XXI.  THE REVERSION OF THE BEAST FOLK.
159	
159	
159	IN this way I became one among the Beast People in the Island
159	of Doctor Moreau.  When I awoke, it was dark about me.  My arm ached
159	in its bandages.  I sat up, wondering at first where I might be.
159	I heard coarse voices talking outside.  Then I saw that my
159	barricade had gone, and that the opening of the hut stood clear.
159	My revolver was still in my hand.
159	
159	I heard something breathing, saw something crouched together
159	close beside me.  I held my breath, trying to see what it was.
159	It began to move slowly, interminably.  Then something soft and warm
159	and moist passed across my hand.  All my muscles contracted.  I snatched
159	my hand away.  A cry of alarm began and was stifled in my throat.
159	Then I just realised what had happened sufficiently to stay my fingers on
159	the revolver.
159	
159	""Who is that?""  I said in a hoarse whisper, the revolver still pointed.
159	
159	""I--Master.""
159	
159	""Who are you?""
159	
159	""They say there is no Master now.  But I know, I know.  I carried the
159	bodies into the sea, O Walker in the Sea! the bodies of those you slew.
159	I am your slave, Master.""
159	
159	""Are you the one I met on the beach?"" I asked.
159	
159	""The same, Master.""
159	
159	The Thing was evidently faithful enough, for it might have fallen
159	upon me as I slept.  ""It is well,"" I said, extending my hand for
159	another licking kiss.  I began to realise what its presence meant,
159	and the tide of my courage flowed.  ""Where are the others?""
159	I asked.
159	
159	""They are mad; they are fools,"" said the Dog-man.  ""Even now they
159	talk together beyond there.  They say, 'The Master is dead.
159	The Other with the Whip is dead.  That Other who walked in the Sea is
159	as we are.  We have no Master, no Whips, no House of Pain, any more.
159	There is an end.  We love the Law, and will keep it; but there
159	is no Pain, no Master, no Whips for ever again.'  So they say.
159	But I know, Master, I know.""
159	
159	I felt in the darkness, and patted the Dog-man's head.  ""It is well,""
159	I said again.
159	
159	""Presently you will slay them all,"" said the Dog-man.
159	
159	""Presently,"" I answered, ""I will slay them all,--after certain
159	days and certain things have come to pass.  Every one of them save
159	those you spare, every one of them shall be slain.""
159	
159	""What the Master wishes to kill, the Master kills,"" said the Dog-man
159	with a certain satisfaction in his voice.
159	
159	""And that their sins may grow,"" I said, ""let them live in their folly
159	until their time is ripe.  Let them not know that I am the Master.""
159	
159	""The Master's will is sweet,"" said the Dog-man, with the ready tact
159	of his canine blood.
159	
159	""But one has sinned,"" said I. ""Him I will kill, whenever I may meet him.
159	When I say to you, 'That is he,' see that you fall upon him.
159	And now I will go to the men and women who are assembled together.""
159	
159	For a moment the opening of the hut was blackened by the exit of
159	the Dog-man. Then I followed and stood up, almost in the exact spot
159	where I had been when I had heard Moreau and his staghound pursuing me.
159	But now it was night, and all the miasmatic ravine about me was black;
159	and beyond, instead of a green, sunlit slope, I saw a red fire,
159	before which hunched, grotesque figures moved to and fro.
159	Farther were the thick trees, a bank of darkness, fringed above
159	with the black lace of the upper branches.  The moon was just riding
159	up on the edge of the ravine, and like a bar across its face drove
159	the spire of vapour that was for ever streaming from the fumaroles of
159	the island.
159	
159	""Walk by me,"" said I, nerving myself; and side by side we walked
159	down the narrow way, taking little heed of the dim Things that peered
159	at us out of the huts.
159	
159	None about the fire attempted to salute me.  Most of them
159	disregarded me, ostentatiously.  I looked round for the Hyena-swine,
159	but he was not there.  Altogether, perhaps twenty of the Beast
159	Folk squatted, staring into the fire or talking to one another.
159	
159	""He is dead, he is dead! the Master is dead!"" said the voice
159	of the Ape-man to the right of me.  ""The House of Pain--there
159	is no House of Pain!""
159	
159	""He is not dead,"" said I, in a loud voice.  ""Even now he watches us!""
159	
159	This startled them.  Twenty pairs of eyes regarded me.
159	
159	""The House of Pain is gone,"" said I. ""It will come again.
159	The Master you cannot see; yet even now he listens among you.""
159	
159	""True, true!"" said the Dog-man.
159	
159	They were staggered at my assurance.  An animal may be ferocious
159	and cunning enough, but it takes a real man to tell a lie.
159	
159	""The Man with the Bandaged Arm speaks a strange thing,""
159	said one of the Beast Folk.
159	
159	""I tell you it is so,"" I said.  ""The Master and the House of Pain
159	will come again.  Woe be to him who breaks the Law!""
159	
159	They looked curiously at one another.  With an affectation of indifference
159	I began to chop idly at the ground in front of me with my hatchet.
159	They looked, I noticed, at the deep cuts I made in the turf.
159	
159	Then the Satyr raised a doubt.  I answered him.  Then one of the dappled
159	things objected, and an animated discussion sprang up round the fire.
159	Every moment I began to feel more convinced of my present security.
159	I talked now without the catching in my breath, due to the intensity
159	of my excitement, that had troubled me at first.  In the course of about
159	an hour I had really convinced several of the Beast Folk of the truth
159	of my assertions, and talked most of the others into a dubious state.
159	I kept a sharp eye for my enemy the Hyena-swine, but he never appeared.
159	Every now and then a suspicious movement would startle me, but my
159	confidence grew rapidly.  Then as the moon crept down from the zenith,
159	one by one the listeners began to yawn (showing the oddest teeth in
159	the light of the sinking fire), and first one and then another retired
159	towards the dens in the ravine; and I, dreading the silence and darkness,
159	went with them, knowing I was safer with several of them than with
159	one alone.
159	
159	In this manner began the longer part of my sojourn upon this
159	Island of Doctor Moreau.  But from that night until the end came,
159	there was but one thing happened to tell save a series of innumerable
159	small unpleasant details and the fretting of an incessant uneasiness.
159	So that I prefer to make no chronicle for that gap of time,
159	to tell only one cardinal incident of the ten months I spent as an
159	intimate of these half-humanised brutes.  There is much that sticks
159	in my memory that I could write,--things that I would cheerfully
159	give my right hand to forget; but they do not help the telling of
159	the story.
159	
159	In the retrospect it is strange to remember how soon I fell
159	in with these monsters' ways, and gained my confidence again.
159	I had my quarrels with them of course, and could show some of
159	their teeth-marks still; but they soon gained a wholesome respect
159	for my trick of throwing stones and for the bite of my hatchet.
159	And my Saint-Bernard-man's loyalty was of infinite service to me.
159	I found their simple scale of honour was based mainly on the capacity
159	for inflicting trenchant wounds.  Indeed, I may say--without vanity,
159	I hope--that I held something like pre-eminence among them.
159	One or two, whom in a rare access of high spirits I had scarred
159	rather badly, bore me a grudge; but it vented itself chiefly
159	behind my back, and at a safe distance from my missiles,
159	in grimaces.
159	
159	The Hyena-swine avoided me, and I was always on the alert for him.
159	My inseparable Dog-man hated and dreaded him intensely.
159	I really believe that was at the root of the brute's attachment to me.
159	It was soon evident to me that the former monster had tasted blood,
159	and gone the way of the Leopard-man. He formed a lair somewhere in
159	the forest, and became solitary.  Once I tried to induce the Beast Folk to
159	hunt him, but I lacked the authority to make them co-operate for one end.
159	Again and again I tried to approach his den and come upon him unaware;
159	but always he was too acute for me, and saw or winded me and got away.
159	He too made every forest pathway dangerous to me and my ally
159	with his lurking ambuscades.  The Dog-man scarcely dared to leave
159	my side.
159	
159	In the first month or so the Beast Folk, compared with their
159	latter condition, were human enough, and for one or two besides
159	my canine friend I even conceived a friendly tolerance.
159	The little pink sloth-creature displayed an odd affection for me,
159	and took to following me about.  The Monkey-man bored me, however;
159	he assumed, on the strength of his five digits, that he was my equal,
159	and was for ever jabbering at me,--jabbering the most arrant nonsense.
159	One thing about him entertained me a little:  he had a fantastic trick
159	of coining new words.  He had an idea, I believe, that to gabble
159	about names that meant nothing was the proper use of speech.
159	He called it ""Big Thinks"" to distinguish it from ""Little Thinks,""
159	the sane every-day interests of life.  If ever I made a remark
159	he did not understand, he would praise it very much, ask me to say
159	it again, learn it by heart, and go off repeating it, with a word
159	wrong here or there, to all the milder of the Beast People.
159	He thought nothing of what was plain and comprehensible.
159	I invented some very curious ""Big Thinks"" for his especial use.
159	I think now that he was the silliest creature I ever met;
159	he had developed in the most wonderful way the distinctive silliness
159	of man without losing one jot of the natural folly of a monkey.
159	
159	This, I say, was in the earlier weeks of my solitude among these brutes.
159	During that time they respected the usage established by the Law,
159	and behaved with general decorum.  Once I found another rabbit torn
159	to pieces,--by the Hyena-swine, I am assured,--but that was all.
159	It was about May when I first distinctly perceived a growing difference
159	in their speech and carriage, a growing coarseness of articulation,
159	a growing disinclination to talk.  My Monkey-man's jabber multiplied
159	in volume but grew less and less comprehensible, more and more simian.
159	Some of the others seemed altogether slipping their hold upon speech,
159	though they still understood what I said to them at that time.
159	(Can you imagine language, once clear-cut and exact, softening and
159	guttering, losing shape and import, becoming mere lumps of sound again?)
159	And they walked erect with an increasing difficulty.  Though they
159	evidently felt ashamed of themselves, every now and then I would come
159	upon one or another running on toes and finger-tips, and quite unable
159	to recover the vertical attitude.  They held things more clumsily;
159	drinking by suction, feeding by gnawing, grew commoner every day.
159	I realised more keenly than ever what Moreau had told me about
159	the ""stubborn beast-flesh."" They were reverting, and reverting very
159	rapidly.
159	
159	Some of them--the pioneers in this, I noticed with some surprise,
159	were all females--began to disregard the injunction of decency,
159	deliberately for the most part.  Others even attempted public outrages
159	upon the institution of monogamy.  The tradition of the Law was clearly
159	losing its force.  I cannot pursue this disagreeable subject.
159	
159	My Dog-man imperceptibly slipped back to the dog again; day by day
159	he became dumb, quadrupedal, hairy.  I scarcely noticed the transition
159	from the companion on my right hand to the lurching dog at my side.
159	
159	As the carelessness and disorganisation increased from day to day,
159	the lane of dwelling places, at no time very sweet, became so
159	loathsome that I left it, and going across the island made myself
159	a hovel of boughs amid the black ruins of Moreau's enclosure.
159	Some memory of pain, I found, still made that place the safest from
159	the Beast Folk.
159	
159	It would be impossible to detail every step of the lapsing of
159	these monsters,--to tell how, day by day, the human semblance left them;
159	how they gave up bandagings and wrappings, abandoned at last every
159	stitch of clothing; how the hair began to spread over the exposed limbs;
159	how their foreheads fell away and their faces projected;
159	how the quasi-human intimacy I had permitted myself with some
159	of them in the first month of my loneliness became a shuddering
159	horror to recall.
159	
159	The change was slow and inevitable.  For them and for me it came
159	without any definite shock.  I still went among them in safety,
159	because no jolt in the downward glide had released the increasing
159	charge of explosive animalism that ousted the human day by day.
159	But I began to fear that soon now that shock must come.
159	My Saint-Bernard-brute followed me to the enclosure every night,
159	and his vigilance enabled me to sleep at times in something like peace.
159	The little pink sloth-thing became shy and left me, to crawl back
159	to its natural life once more among the tree-branches. We were in just
159	the state of equilibrium that would remain in one of those ""Happy Family""
159	cages which animal-tamers exhibit, if the tamer were to leave it
159	for ever.
159	
159	Of course these creatures did not decline into such beasts as
159	the reader has seen in zoological gardens,--into ordinary bears,
159	wolves, tigers, oxen, swine, and apes.  There was still something
159	strange about each; in each Moreau had blended this animal with that.
159	One perhaps was ursine chiefly, another feline chiefly, another
159	bovine chiefly; but each was tainted with other creatures,--a kind
159	of generalised animalism appearing through the specific dispositions.
159	And the dwindling shreds of the humanity still startled me every
159	now and then,--a momentary recrudescence of speech perhaps,
159	an unexpected dexterity of the fore-feet, a pitiful attempt to
159	walk erect.
159	
159	I too must have undergone strange changes.  My clothes hung about
159	me as yellow rags, through whose rents showed the tanned skin.
159	My hair grew long, and became matted together.  I am told that
159	even now my eyes have a strange brightness, a swift alertness
159	of movement.
159	
159	At first I spent the daylight hours on the southward beach
159	watching for a ship, hoping and praying for a ship.
159	I counted on the ""Ipecacuanha"" returning as the year wore on;
159	but she never came.  Five times I saw sails, and thrice smoke;
159	but nothing ever touched the island.  I always had a bonfire ready,
159	but no doubt the volcanic reputation of the island was taken to account
159	for that.
159	
159	It was only about September or October that I began to think of making
159	a raft.  By that time my arm had healed, and both my hands were at
159	my service again.  At first, I found my helplessness appalling.
159	I had never done any carpentry or such-like work in my life, and I spent
159	day after day in experimental chopping and binding among the trees.
159	I had no ropes, and could hit on nothing wherewith to make ropes;
159	none of the abundant creepers seemed limber or strong enough,
159	and with all my litter of scientific education I could not devise
159	any way of making them so.  I spent more than a fortnight
159	grubbing among the black ruins of the enclosure and on
159	the beach where the boats had been burnt, looking for nails
159	and other stray pieces of metal that might prove of service.
159	Now and then some Beast-creature would watch me, and go leaping
159	off when I called to it.  There came a season of thunder-storms
159	and heavy rain, which greatly retarded my work; but at last the raft
159	was completed.
159	
159	I was delighted with it.  But with a certain lack of practical sense
159	which has always been my bane, I had made it a mile or more from the sea;
159	and before I had dragged it down to the beach the thing had fallen
159	to pieces.  Perhaps it is as well that I was saved from launching it;
159	but at the time my misery at my failure was so acute that for some
159	days I simply moped on the beach, and stared at the water and thought
159	of death.
159	
159	I did not, however, mean to die, and an incident occurred that warned
159	me unmistakably of the folly of letting the days pass so,--for each
159	fresh day was fraught with increasing danger from the Beast People.
159	
159	I was lying in the shade of the enclosure wall, staring out to sea,
159	when I was startled by something cold touching the skin of my heel,
159	and starting round found the little pink sloth-creature blinking
159	into my face.  He had long since lost speech and active movement,
159	and the lank hair of the little brute grew thicker every day and his
159	stumpy claws more askew.  He made a moaning noise when he saw he had
159	attracted my attention, went a little way towards the bushes and looked
159	back at me.
159	
159	At first I did not understand, but presently it occurred to me that
159	he wished me to follow him; and this I did at last,--slowly, for the day
159	was hot.  When we reached the trees he clambered into them, for he could
159	travel better among their swinging creepers than on the ground.
159	And suddenly in a trampled space I came upon a ghastly group.
159	My Saint-Bernard-creature lay on the ground, dead; and near
159	his body crouched the Hyena-swine, gripping the quivering flesh
159	with its misshapen claws, gnawing at it, and snarling with delight.
159	As I approached, the monster lifted its glaring eyes to mine,
159	its lips went trembling back from its red-stained teeth,
159	and it growled menacingly.  It was not afraid and not ashamed;
159	the last vestige of the human taint had vanished.  I advanced a step
159	farther, stopped, and pulled out my revolver.  At last I had him face
159	to face.
159	
159	The brute made no sign of retreat; but its ears went back,
159	its hair bristled, and its body crouched together.
159	I aimed between the eyes and fired.  As I did so, the Thing rose
159	straight at me in a leap, and I was knocked over like a ninepin.
159	It clutched at me with its crippled hand, and struck me in the face.
159	Its spring carried it over me.  I fell under the hind part of its body;
159	but luckily I had hit as I meant, and it had died even as it leapt.
159	I crawled out from under its unclean weight and stood up trembling,
159	staring at its quivering body.  That danger at least was over;
159	but this, I knew was only the first of the series of relapses that
159	must come.
159	
159	I burnt both of the bodies on a pyre of brushwood; but after that I saw
159	that unless I left the island my death was only a question of time.
159	The Beast People by that time had, with one or two exceptions,
159	left the ravine and made themselves lairs according to their taste
159	among the thickets of the island.  Few prowled by day, most of
159	them slept, and the island might have seemed deserted to a new-comer;
159	but at night the air was hideous with their calls and howling.
159	I had half a mind to make a massacre of them; to build traps,
159	or fight them with my knife.  Had I possessed sufficient cartridges,
159	I should not have hesitated to begin the killing.  There could
159	now be scarcely a score left of the dangerous carnivores;
159	the braver of these were already dead.  After the death of this poor
159	dog of mine, my last friend, I too adopted to some extent the practice
159	of slumbering in the daytime in order to be on my guard at night.
159	I rebuilt my den in the walls of the enclosure, with such a narrow
159	opening that anything attempting to enter must necessarily make
159	a considerable noise.  The creatures had lost the art of fire too,
159	and recovered their fear of it.  I turned once more, almost passionately
159	now, to hammering together stakes and branches to form a raft for
159	my escape.
159	
159	I found a thousand difficulties.  I am an extremely unhandy man
159	(my schooling was over before the days of Slojd); but most
159	of the requirements of a raft I met at last in some clumsy,
159	circuitous way or other, and this time I took care of the strength.
159	The only insurmountable obstacle was that I had no vessel to contain
159	the water I should need if I floated forth upon these untravelled seas.
159	I would have even tried pottery, but the island contained no clay.
159	I used to go moping about the island trying with all my might
159	to solve this one last difficulty.  Sometimes I would give
159	way to wild outbursts of rage, and hack and splinter some
159	unlucky tree in my intolerable vexation.  But I could think
159	of nothing.
159	
159	And then came a day, a wonderful day, which I spent in ecstasy.
159	I saw a sail to the southwest, a small sail like that of a little schooner;
159	and forthwith I lit a great pile of brushwood, and stood by it in
159	the heat of it, and the heat of the midday sun, watching.  All day I
159	watched that sail, eating or drinking nothing, so that my head reeled;
159	and the Beasts came and glared at me, and seemed to wonder,
159	and went away.  It was still distant when night came and swallowed
159	it up; and all night I toiled to keep my blaze bright and high,
159	and the eyes of the Beasts shone out of the darkness, marvelling.
159	In the dawn the sail was nearer, and I saw it was the dirty
159	lug-sail of a small boat.  But it sailed strangely.  My eyes were
159	weary with watching, and I peered and could not believe them.
159	Two men were in the boat, sitting low down,--one by the bows,
159	the other at the rudder.  The head was not kept to the wind; it yawed and
159	fell away.
159	
159	As the day grew brighter, I began waving the last rag of my jacket to them;
159	but they did not notice me, and sat still, facing each other.  I went
159	to the lowest point of the low headland, and gesticulated and shouted.
159	There was no response, and the boat kept on her aimless course,
159	making slowly, very slowly, for the bay.  Suddenly a great white bird
159	flew up out of the boat, and neither of the men stirred nor noticed it;
159	it circled round, and then came sweeping overhead with its strong
159	wings outspread.
159	
159	Then I stopped shouting, and sat down on the headland and rested my chin
159	on my hands and stared.  Slowly, slowly, the boat drove past towards
159	the west.  I would have swum out to it, but something--a cold, vague
159	fear--kept me back.  In the afternoon the tide stranded the boat, and left
159	it a hundred yards or so to the westward of the ruins of the enclosure.
159	The men in it were dead, had been dead so long that they fell
159	to pieces when I tilted the boat on its side and dragged them out.
159	One had a shock of red hair, like the captain of the ""Ipecacuanha,"" and
159	a dirty white cap lay in the bottom of the boat.
159	
159	As I stood beside the boat, three of the Beasts came slinking
159	out of the bushes and sniffing towards me.  One of my spasms
159	of disgust came upon me.  I thrust the little boat down the beach
159	and clambered on board her.  Two of the brutes were Wolf-beasts,
159	and came forward with quivering nostrils and glittering eyes;
159	the third was the horrible nondescript of bear and bull.
159	When I saw them approaching those wretched remains, heard them
159	snarling at one another and caught the gleam of their teeth,
159	a frantic horror succeeded my repulsion.  I turned my back upon them,
159	struck the lug and began paddling out to sea.  I could not bring myself
159	to look behind me.
159	
159	I lay, however, between the reef and the island that night,
159	and the next morning went round to the stream and filled the empty
159	keg aboard with water.  Then, with such patience as I could command,
159	I collected a quantity of fruit, and waylaid and killed two rabbits
159	with my last three cartridges.  While I was doing this I left
159	the boat moored to an inward projection of the reef, for fear
159	of the Beast People.
159	
159	
159	
159	
159	XXII.  THE MAN ALONE.
159	
159	
159	IN the evening I started, and drove out to sea before a gentle wind
159	from the southwest, slowly, steadily; and the island grew smaller
159	and smaller, and the lank spire of smoke dwindled to a finer and
159	finer line against the hot sunset.  The ocean rose up around me,
159	hiding that low, dark patch from my eyes.  The daylight, the trailing
159	glory of the sun, went streaming out of the sky, was drawn aside
159	like some luminous curtain, and at last I looked into the blue
159	gulf of immensity which the sunshine hides, and saw the floating
159	hosts of the stars.  The sea was silent, the sky was silent.
159	I was alone with the night and silence.
159	
159	So I drifted for three days, eating and drinking sparingly, and meditating
159	upon all that had happened to me,--not desiring very greatly then to see
159	men again.  One unclean rag was about me, my hair a black tangle:
159	no doubt my discoverers thought me a madman.
159	
159	It is strange, but I felt no desire to return to mankind.
159	I was only glad to be quit of the foulness of the Beast People.
159	And on the third day I was picked up by a brig from Apia to San Francisco.
159	Neither the captain nor the mate would believe my story, judging that
159	solitude and danger had made me mad; and fearing their opinion might
159	be that of others, I refrained from telling my adventure further,
159	and professed to recall nothing that had happened to me between
159	the loss of the ""Lady Vain"" and the time when I was picked up again,--the
159	space of a year.
159	
159	I had to act with the utmost circumspection to save myself from the
159	suspicion of insanity.  My memory of the Law, of the two dead sailors,
159	of the ambuscades of the darkness, of the body in the canebrake,
159	haunted me; and, unnatural as it seems, with my return to mankind came,
159	instead of that confidence and sympathy I had expected, a strange
159	enhancement of the uncertainty and dread I had experienced
159	during my stay upon the island.  No one would believe me;
159	I was almost as queer to men as I had been to the Beast People.
159	I may have caught something of the natural wildness of my companions.
159	They say that terror is a disease, and anyhow I can witness that for
159	several years now a restless fear has dwelt in my mind,--such a restless
159	fear as a half-tamed lion cub may feel.
159	
159	My trouble took the strangest form.  I could not persuade myself
159	that the men and women I met were not also another Beast People,
159	animals half wrought into the outward image of human souls, and that they
159	would presently begin to revert,--to show first this bestial mark
159	and then that.  But I have confided my case to a strangely able
159	man,--a man who had known Moreau, and seemed half to credit my story;
159	a mental specialist,--and he has helped me mightily, though I do not
159	expect that the terror of that island will ever altogether leave me.
159	At most times it lies far in the back of my mind, a mere distant cloud,
159	a memory, and a faint distrust; but there are times when the little
159	cloud spreads until it obscures the whole sky.  Then I look about me
159	at my fellow-men; and I go in fear.  I see faces, keen and bright;
159	others dull or dangerous; others, unsteady, insincere,--none that
159	have the calm authority of a reasonable soul.  I feel as though
159	the animal was surging up through them; that presently the degradation
159	of the Islanders will be played over again on a larger scale.
159	I know this is an illusion; that these seeming men and women about
159	me are indeed men and women,--men and women for ever, perfectly
159	reasonable creatures, full of human desires and tender solicitude,
159	emancipated from instinct and the slaves of no fantastic
159	Law,--beings altogether different from the Beast Folk.  Yet I shrink
159	from them, from their curious glances, their inquiries and assistance,
159	and long to be away from them and alone.  For that reason I live near
159	the broad free downland, and can escape thither when this shadow
159	is over my soul; and very sweet is the empty downland then, under the
159	wind-swept sky.
159	
159	When I lived in London the horror was well-nigh insupportable.
159	I could not get away from men:  their voices came through windows;
159	locked doors were flimsy safeguards.  I would go out into the streets
159	to fight with my delusion, and prowling women would mew after me;
159	furtive, craving men glance jealously at me; weary, pale workers
159	go coughing by me with tired eyes and eager paces, like wounded
159	deer dripping blood; old people, bent and dull, pass murmuring
159	to themselves; and, all unheeding, a ragged tail of gibing children.
159	Then I would turn aside into some chapel,--and even there,
159	such was my disturbance, it seemed that the preacher gibbered
159	""Big Thinks,"" even as the Ape-man had done; or into some library,
159	and there the intent faces over the books seemed but patient
159	creatures waiting for prey.  Particularly nauseous were the blank,
159	expressionless faces of people in trains and omnibuses;
159	they seemed no more my fellow-creatures than dead bodies would be,
159	so that I did not dare to travel unless I was assured of being alone.
159	And even it seemed that I too was not a reasonable creature,
159	but only an animal tormented with some strange disorder in its
159	brain which sent it to wander alone, like a sheep stricken
159	with gid.
159	
159	This is a mood, however, that comes to me now, I thank God,
159	more rarely.  I have withdrawn myself from the confusion of cities
159	and multitudes, and spend my days surrounded by wise books,--bright
159	windows in this life of ours, lit by the shining souls of men.
159	I see few strangers, and have but a small household.
159	My days I devote to reading and to experiments in chemistry,
159	and I spend many of the clear nights in the study of astronomy.
159	There is--though I do not know how there is or why there is--a sense
159	of infinite peace and protection in the glittering hosts of heaven.
159	There it must be, I think, in the vast and eternal laws of matter,
159	and not in the daily cares and sins and troubles of men, that whatever
159	is more than animal within us must find its solace and its hope.  I hope,
159	or I could not live.
159	
159	And so, in hope and solitude, my story ends.
159

5230	CHAPTER I
5230	
5230	THE STRANGE MAN'S ARRIVAL
5230	
5230	
5230	The stranger came early in February, one wintry day, through a
5230	biting wind and a driving snow, the last snowfall of the year, over
5230	the down, walking from Bramblehurst railway station, and carrying a
5230	little black portmanteau in his thickly gloved hand. He was wrapped
5230	up from head to foot, and the brim of his soft felt hat hid every
5230	inch of his face but the shiny tip of his nose; the snow had piled
5230	itself against his shoulders and chest, and added a white crest to
5230	the burden he carried. He staggered into the ""Coach and Horses"" more
5230	dead than alive, and flung his portmanteau down. ""A fire,"" he cried,
5230	""in the name of human charity! A room and a fire!"" He stamped and
5230	shook the snow from off himself in the bar, and followed Mrs. Hall
5230	into her guest parlour to strike his bargain. And with that much
5230	introduction, that and a couple of sovereigns flung upon the table,
5230	he took up his quarters in the inn.
5230	
5230	Mrs. Hall lit the fire and left him there while she went to prepare
5230	him a meal with her own hands. A guest to stop at Iping in the
5230	wintertime was an unheard-of piece of luck, let alone a guest who
5230	was no ""haggler,"" and she was resolved to show herself worthy of her
5230	good fortune. As soon as the bacon was well under way, and Millie,
5230	her lymphatic maid, had been brisked up a bit by a few deftly chosen
5230	expressions of contempt, she carried the cloth, plates, and glasses
5230	into the parlour and began to lay them with the utmost _eclat_.
5230	Although the fire was burning up briskly, she was surprised to see
5230	that her visitor still wore his hat and coat, standing with his back
5230	to her and staring out of the window at the falling snow in the yard.
5230	His gloved hands were clasped behind him, and he seemed to be lost
5230	in thought. She noticed that the melting snow that still sprinkled
5230	his shoulders dripped upon her carpet. ""Can I take your hat and coat,
5230	sir?"" she said, ""and give them a good dry in the kitchen?""
5230	
5230	""No,"" he said without turning.
5230	
5230	She was not sure she had heard him, and was about to repeat her
5230	question.
5230	
5230	He turned his head and looked at her over his shoulder. ""I prefer to
5230	keep them on,"" he said with emphasis, and she noticed that he wore
5230	big blue spectacles with sidelights, and had a bush side-whisker
5230	over his coat-collar that completely hid his cheeks and face.
5230	
5230	""Very well, sir,"" she said. ""_As_ you like. In a bit the room will
5230	be warmer.""
5230	
5230	He made no answer, and had turned his face away from her again, and
5230	Mrs. Hall, feeling that her conversational advances were ill-timed,
5230	laid the rest of the table things in a quick staccato and whisked
5230	out of the room. When she returned he was still standing there, like
5230	a man of stone, his back hunched, his collar turned up, his dripping
5230	hat-brim turned down, hiding his face and ears completely. She put
5230	down the eggs and bacon with considerable emphasis, and called
5230	rather than said to him, ""Your lunch is served, sir.""
5230	
5230	""Thank you,"" he said at the same time, and did not stir until she
5230	was closing the door. Then he swung round and approached the table
5230	with a certain eager quickness.
5230	
5230	As she went behind the bar to the kitchen she heard a sound repeated
5230	at regular intervals. Chirk, chirk, chirk, it went, the sound of a
5230	spoon being rapidly whisked round a basin. ""That girl!"" she said.
5230	""There! I clean forgot it. It's her being so long!"" And while she
5230	herself finished mixing the mustard, she gave Millie a few verbal
5230	stabs for her excessive slowness. She had cooked the ham and eggs,
5230	laid the table, and done everything, while Millie (help indeed!) had
5230	only succeeded in delaying the mustard. And him a new guest and
5230	wanting to stay! Then she filled the mustard pot, and, putting it
5230	with a certain stateliness upon a gold and black tea-tray, carried
5230	it into the parlour.
5230	
5230	She rapped and entered promptly. As she did so her visitor moved
5230	quickly, so that she got but a glimpse of a white object disappearing
5230	behind the table. It would seem he was picking something from the
5230	floor. She rapped down the mustard pot on the table, and then she
5230	noticed the overcoat and hat had been taken off and put over a chair
5230	in front of the fire, and a pair of wet boots threatened rust to her
5230	steel fender. She went to these things resolutely. ""I suppose I may
5230	have them to dry now,"" she said in a voice that brooked no denial.
5230	
5230	""Leave the hat,"" said her visitor, in a muffled voice, and turning
5230	she saw he had raised his head and was sitting and looking at her.
5230	
5230	For a moment she stood gaping at him, too surprised to speak.
5230	
5230	He held a white cloth--it was a serviette he had brought with
5230	him--over the lower part of his face, so that his mouth and jaws
5230	were completely hidden, and that was the reason of his muffled
5230	voice. But it was not that which startled Mrs. Hall. It was the fact
5230	that all his forehead above his blue glasses was covered by a white
5230	bandage, and that another covered his ears, leaving not a scrap of
5230	his face exposed excepting only his pink, peaked nose. It was bright,
5230	pink, and shiny just as it had been at first. He wore a dark-brown
5230	velvet jacket with a high, black, linen-lined collar turned up about
5230	his neck. The thick black hair, escaping as it could below and
5230	between the cross bandages, projected in curious tails and horns,
5230	giving him the strangest appearance conceivable. This muffled and
5230	bandaged head was so unlike what she had anticipated, that for a
5230	moment she was rigid.
5230	
5230	He did not remove the serviette, but remained holding it, as she
5230	saw now, with a brown gloved hand, and regarding her with his
5230	inscrutable blue glasses. ""Leave the hat,"" he said, speaking very
5230	distinctly through the white cloth.
5230	
5230	Her nerves began to recover from the shock they had received. She
5230	placed the hat on the chair again by the fire. ""I didn't know, sir,""
5230	she began, ""that--"" and she stopped embarrassed.
5230	
5230	""Thank you,"" he said drily, glancing from her to the door and then
5230	at her again.
5230	
5230	""I'll have them nicely dried, sir, at once,"" she said, and carried
5230	his clothes out of the room. She glanced at his white-swathed head
5230	and blue goggles again as she was going out of the door; but his
5230	napkin was still in front of his face. She shivered a little as she
5230	closed the door behind her, and her face was eloquent of her surprise
5230	and perplexity. ""I _never_,"" she whispered. ""There!"" She went quite
5230	softly to the kitchen, and was too preoccupied to ask Millie what
5230	she was messing about with _now_, when she got there.
5230	
5230	The visitor sat and listened to her retreating feet. He glanced
5230	inquiringly at the window before he removed his serviette, and
5230	resumed his meal. He took a mouthful, glanced suspiciously at the
5230	window, took another mouthful, then rose and, taking the serviette
5230	in his hand, walked across the room and pulled the blind down to
5230	the top of the white muslin that obscured the lower panes. This
5230	left the room in a twilight. This done, he returned with an easier
5230	air to the table and his meal.
5230	
5230	""The poor soul's had an accident or an op'ration or somethin',"" said
5230	Mrs. Hall. ""What a turn them bandages did give me, to be sure!""
5230	
5230	She put on some more coal, unfolded the clothes-horse, and extended
5230	the traveller's coat upon this. ""And they goggles! Why, he looked
5230	more like a divin' helmet than a human man!"" She hung his muffler
5230	on a corner of the horse. ""And holding that handkerchief over his
5230	mouth all the time. Talkin' through it! ... Perhaps his mouth was
5230	hurt too--maybe.""
5230	
5230	She turned round, as one who suddenly remembers. ""Bless my soul
5230	alive!"" she said, going off at a tangent; ""ain't you done them
5230	taters _yet_, Millie?""
5230	
5230	When Mrs. Hall went to clear away the stranger's lunch, her idea
5230	that his mouth must also have been cut or disfigured in the accident
5230	she supposed him to have suffered, was confirmed, for he was smoking
5230	a pipe, and all the time that she was in the room he never loosened
5230	the silk muffler he had wrapped round the lower part of his face to
5230	put the mouthpiece to his lips. Yet it was not forgetfulness, for
5230	she saw he glanced at it as it smouldered out. He sat in the corner
5230	with his back to the window-blind and spoke now, having eaten and
5230	drunk and being comfortably warmed through, with less aggressive
5230	brevity than before. The reflection of the fire lent a kind of red
5230	animation to his big spectacles they had lacked hitherto.
5230	
5230	""I have some luggage,"" he said, ""at Bramblehurst station,"" and he
5230	asked her how he could have it sent. He bowed his bandaged head
5230	quite politely in acknowledgment of her explanation. ""To-morrow?"" he
5230	said. ""There is no speedier delivery?"" and seemed quite disappointed
5230	when she answered, ""No."" Was she quite sure? No man with a trap who
5230	would go over?
5230	
5230	Mrs. Hall, nothing loath, answered his questions and developed a
5230	conversation. ""It's a steep road by the down, sir,"" she said in
5230	answer to the question about a trap; and then, snatching at an
5230	opening, said, ""It was there a carriage was upsettled, a year ago
5230	and more. A gentleman killed, besides his coachman. Accidents, sir,
5230	happen in a moment, don't they?""
5230	
5230	But the visitor was not to be drawn so easily. ""They do,"" he said
5230	through his muffler, eyeing her quietly through his impenetrable
5230	glasses.
5230	
5230	""But they take long enough to get well, don't they? ... There was
5230	my sister's son, Tom, jest cut his arm with a scythe, tumbled on it
5230	in the 'ayfield, and, bless me! he was three months tied up sir.
5230	You'd hardly believe it. It's regular given me a dread of a scythe,
5230	sir.""
5230	
5230	""I can quite understand that,"" said the visitor.
5230	
5230	""He was afraid, one time, that he'd have to have an op'ration--he
5230	was that bad, sir.""
5230	
5230	The visitor laughed abruptly, a bark of a laugh that he seemed to
5230	bite and kill in his mouth. ""_Was_ he?"" he said.
5230	
5230	""He was, sir. And no laughing matter to them as had the doing for
5230	him, as I had--my sister being took up with her little ones so
5230	much. There was bandages to do, sir, and bandages to undo. So that
5230	if I may make so bold as to say it, sir--""
5230	
5230	""Will you get me some matches?"" said the visitor, quite abruptly.
5230	""My pipe is out.""
5230	
5230	Mrs. Hall was pulled up suddenly. It was certainly rude of him,
5230	after telling him all she had done. She gasped at him for a moment,
5230	and remembered the two sovereigns. She went for the matches.
5230	
5230	""Thanks,"" he said concisely, as she put them down, and turned his
5230	shoulder upon her and stared out of the window again. It was
5230	altogether too discouraging. Evidently he was sensitive on the
5230	topic of operations and bandages. She did not ""make so bold as to
5230	say,"" however, after all. But his snubbing way had irritated her,
5230	and Millie had a hot time of it that afternoon.
5230	
5230	The visitor remained in the parlour until four o'clock, without
5230	giving the ghost of an excuse for an intrusion. For the most part
5230	he was quite still during that time; it would seem he sat in the
5230	growing darkness smoking in the firelight--perhaps dozing.
5230	
5230	Once or twice a curious listener might have heard him at the coals,
5230	and for the space of five minutes he was audible pacing the room.
5230	He seemed to be talking to himself. Then the armchair creaked as
5230	he sat down again.
5230	
5230	
5230	
5230	CHAPTER II
5230	
5230	MR. TEDDY HENFREY'S FIRST IMPRESSIONS
5230	
5230	
5230	At four o'clock, when it was fairly dark and Mrs. Hall was screwing
5230	up her courage to go in and ask her visitor if he would take some
5230	tea, Teddy Henfrey, the clock-jobber, came into the bar. ""My sakes!
5230	Mrs. Hall,"" said he, ""but this is terrible weather for thin boots!""
5230	The snow outside was falling faster.
5230	
5230	Mrs. Hall agreed, and then noticed he had his bag with him. ""Now
5230	you're here, Mr. Teddy,"" said she, ""I'd be glad if you'd give th'
5230	old clock in the parlour a bit of a look. 'Tis going, and it strikes
5230	well and hearty; but the hour-hand won't do nuthin' but point at
5230	six.""
5230	
5230	And leading the way, she went across to the parlour door and rapped
5230	and entered.
5230	
5230	Her visitor, she saw as she opened the door, was seated in the
5230	armchair before the fire, dozing it would seem, with his bandaged
5230	head drooping on one side. The only light in the room was the red
5230	glow from the fire--which lit his eyes like adverse railway signals,
5230	but left his downcast face in darkness--and the scanty vestiges of
5230	the day that came in through the open door. Everything was ruddy,
5230	shadowy, and indistinct to her, the more so since she had just been
5230	lighting the bar lamp, and her eyes were dazzled. But for a second
5230	it seemed to her that the man she looked at had an enormous mouth
5230	wide open--a vast and incredible mouth that swallowed the whole of
5230	the lower portion of his face. It was the sensation of a moment:
5230	the white-bound head, the monstrous goggle eyes, and this huge yawn
5230	below it. Then he stirred, started up in his chair, put up his hand.
5230	She opened the door wide, so that the room was lighter, and she saw
5230	him more clearly, with the muffler held up to his face just as she
5230	had seen him hold the serviette before. The shadows, she fancied,
5230	had tricked her.
5230	
5230	""Would you mind, sir, this man a-coming to look at the clock, sir?""
5230	she said, recovering from the momentary shock.
5230	
5230	""Look at the clock?"" he said, staring round in a drowsy manner,
5230	and speaking over his hand, and then, getting more fully awake,
5230	""certainly.""
5230	
5230	Mrs. Hall went away to get a lamp, and he rose and stretched
5230	himself. Then came the light, and Mr. Teddy Henfrey, entering, was
5230	confronted by this bandaged person. He was, he says, ""taken aback.""
5230	
5230	""Good afternoon,"" said the stranger, regarding him--as Mr. Henfrey
5230	says, with a vivid sense of the dark spectacles--""like a lobster.""
5230	
5230	""I hope,"" said Mr. Henfrey, ""that it's no intrusion.""
5230	
5230	""None whatever,"" said the stranger. ""Though, I understand,"" he said
5230	turning to Mrs. Hall, ""that this room is really to be mine for my
5230	own private use.""
5230	
5230	""I thought, sir,"" said Mrs. Hall, ""you'd prefer the clock--""
5230	
5230	""Certainly,"" said the stranger, ""certainly--but, as a rule, I
5230	like to be alone and undisturbed.
5230	
5230	""But I'm really glad to have the clock seen to,"" he said, seeing a
5230	certain hesitation in Mr. Henfrey's manner. ""Very glad."" Mr. Henfrey
5230	had intended to apologise and withdraw, but this anticipation
5230	reassured him. The stranger turned round with his back to the
5230	fireplace and put his hands behind his back. ""And presently,"" he
5230	said, ""when the clock-mending is over, I think I should like to
5230	have some tea. But not till the clock-mending is over.""
5230	
5230	Mrs. Hall was about to leave the room--she made no conversational
5230	advances this time, because she did not want to be snubbed in front
5230	of Mr. Henfrey--when her visitor asked her if she had made any
5230	arrangements about his boxes at Bramblehurst. She told him she had
5230	mentioned the matter to the postman, and that the carrier could
5230	bring them over on the morrow. ""You are certain that is the
5230	earliest?"" he said.
5230	
5230	She was certain, with a marked coldness.
5230	
5230	""I should explain,"" he added, ""what I was really too cold and
5230	fatigued to do before, that I am an experimental investigator.""
5230	
5230	""Indeed, sir,"" said Mrs. Hall, much impressed.
5230	
5230	""And my baggage contains apparatus and appliances.""
5230	
5230	""Very useful things indeed they are, sir,"" said Mrs. Hall.
5230	
5230	""And I'm very naturally anxious to get on with my inquiries.""
5230	
5230	""Of course, sir.""
5230	
5230	""My reason for coming to Iping,"" he proceeded, with a certain
5230	deliberation of manner, ""was ... a desire for solitude. I do not
5230	wish to be disturbed in my work. In addition to my work, an
5230	accident--""
5230	
5230	""I thought as much,"" said Mrs. Hall to herself.
5230	
5230	""--necessitates a certain retirement. My eyes--are sometimes so
5230	weak and painful that I have to shut myself up in the dark for
5230	hours together. Lock myself up. Sometimes--now and then. Not at
5230	present, certainly. At such times the slightest disturbance, the
5230	entry of a stranger into the room, is a source of excruciating
5230	annoyance to me--it is well these things should be understood.""
5230	
5230	""Certainly, sir,"" said Mrs. Hall. ""And if I might make so bold as
5230	to ask--""
5230	
5230	""That I think, is all,"" said the stranger, with that quietly
5230	irresistible air of finality he could assume at will. Mrs. Hall
5230	reserved her question and sympathy for a better occasion.
5230	
5230	After Mrs. Hall had left the room, he remained standing in front of
5230	the fire, glaring, so Mr. Henfrey puts it, at the clock-mending. Mr.
5230	Henfrey not only took off the hands of the clock, and the face, but
5230	extracted the works; and he tried to work in as slow and quiet and
5230	unassuming a manner as possible. He worked with the lamp close to
5230	him, and the green shade threw a brilliant light upon his hands,
5230	and upon the frame and wheels, and left the rest of the room
5230	shadowy. When he looked up, coloured patches swam in his eyes.
5230	Being constitutionally of a curious nature, he had removed the
5230	works--a quite unnecessary proceeding--with the idea of delaying his
5230	departure and perhaps falling into conversation with the stranger.
5230	But the stranger stood there, perfectly silent and still. So still,
5230	it got on Henfrey's nerves. He felt alone in the room and looked up,
5230	and there, grey and dim, was the bandaged head and huge blue lenses
5230	staring fixedly, with a mist of green spots drifting in front of
5230	them. It was so uncanny to Henfrey that for a minute they remained
5230	staring blankly at one another. Then Henfrey looked down again. Very
5230	uncomfortable position! One would like to say something. Should he
5230	remark that the weather was very cold for the time of year?
5230	
5230	He looked up as if to take aim with that introductory shot. ""The
5230	weather--"" he began.
5230	
5230	""Why don't you finish and go?"" said the rigid figure, evidently in
5230	a state of painfully suppressed rage. ""All you've got to do is to
5230	fix the hour-hand on its axle. You're simply humbugging--""
5230	
5230	""Certainly, sir--one minute more. I overlooked--"" and Mr. Henfrey
5230	finished and went.
5230	
5230	But he went feeling excessively annoyed. ""Damn it!"" said Mr. Henfrey
5230	to himself, trudging down the village through the thawing snow; ""a
5230	man must do a clock at times, surely.""
5230	
5230	And again, ""Can't a man look at you?--Ugly!""
5230	
5230	And yet again, ""Seemingly not. If the police was wanting you you
5230	couldn't be more wropped and bandaged.""
5230	
5230	At Gleeson's corner he saw Hall, who had recently married the
5230	stranger's hostess at the ""Coach and Horses,"" and who now drove
5230	the Iping conveyance, when occasional people required it, to
5230	Sidderbridge Junction, coming towards him on his return from that
5230	place. Hall had evidently been ""stopping a bit"" at Sidderbridge,
5230	to judge by his driving. ""'Ow do, Teddy?"" he said, passing.
5230	
5230	""You got a rum un up home!"" said Teddy.
5230	
5230	Hall very sociably pulled up. ""What's that?"" he asked.
5230	
5230	""Rum-looking customer stopping at the 'Coach and Horses,'"" said
5230	Teddy. ""My sakes!""
5230	
5230	And he proceeded to give Hall a vivid description of his grotesque
5230	guest. ""Looks a bit like a disguise, don't it? I'd like to see a
5230	man's face if I had him stopping in _my_ place,"" said Henfrey. ""But
5230	women are that trustful--where strangers are concerned. He's took
5230	your rooms and he ain't even given a name, Hall.""
5230	
5230	""You don't say so!"" said Hall, who was a man of sluggish apprehension.
5230	
5230	""Yes,"" said Teddy. ""By the week. Whatever he is, you can't get rid
5230	of him under the week. And he's got a lot of luggage coming
5230	to-morrow, so he says. Let's hope it won't be stones in boxes, Hall.""
5230	
5230	He told Hall how his aunt at Hastings had been swindled by a
5230	stranger with empty portmanteaux. Altogether he left Hall vaguely
5230	suspicious. ""Get up, old girl,"" said Hall. ""I s'pose I must see
5230	'bout this.""
5230	
5230	Teddy trudged on his way with his mind considerably relieved.
5230	
5230	Instead of ""seeing 'bout it,"" however, Hall on his return was
5230	severely rated by his wife on the length of time he had spent in
5230	Sidderbridge, and his mild inquiries were answered snappishly and
5230	in a manner not to the point. But the seed of suspicion Teddy
5230	had sown germinated in the mind of Mr. Hall in spite of these
5230	discouragements. ""You wim' don't know everything,"" said Mr. Hall,
5230	resolved to ascertain more about the personality of his guest at
5230	the earliest possible opportunity. And after the stranger had gone
5230	to bed, which he did about half-past nine, Mr. Hall went very
5230	aggressively into the parlour and looked very hard at his wife's
5230	furniture, just to show that the stranger wasn't master there,
5230	and scrutinised closely and a little contemptuously a sheet of
5230	mathematical computations the stranger had left. When retiring
5230	for the night he instructed Mrs. Hall to look very closely at
5230	the stranger's luggage when it came next day.
5230	
5230	""You mind your own business, Hall,"" said Mrs. Hall, ""and I'll mind
5230	mine.""
5230	
5230	She was all the more inclined to snap at Hall because the stranger
5230	was undoubtedly an unusually strange sort of stranger, and she was
5230	by no means assured about him in her own mind. In the middle of the
5230	night she woke up dreaming of huge white heads like turnips, that
5230	came trailing after her, at the end of interminable necks, and with
5230	vast black eyes. But being a sensible woman, she subdued her
5230	terrors and turned over and went to sleep again.
5230	
5230	
5230	
5230	CHAPTER III
5230	
5230	THE THOUSAND AND ONE BOTTLES
5230	
5230	
5230	So it was that on the twenty-ninth day of February, at the beginning
5230	of the thaw, this singular person fell out of infinity into Iping
5230	village. Next day his luggage arrived through the slush--and very
5230	remarkable luggage it was. There were a couple of trunks indeed,
5230	such as a rational man might need, but in addition there were
5230	a box of books--big, fat books, of which some were just in an
5230	incomprehensible handwriting--and a dozen or more crates, boxes,
5230	and cases, containing objects packed in straw, as it seemed to
5230	Hall, tugging with a casual curiosity at the straw--glass bottles.
5230	The stranger, muffled in hat, coat, gloves, and wrapper, came out
5230	impatiently to meet Fearenside's cart, while Hall was having a word
5230	or so of gossip preparatory to helping bring them in. Out he came,
5230	not noticing Fearenside's dog, who was sniffing in a _dilettante_
5230	spirit at Hall's legs. ""Come along with those boxes,"" he said.
5230	""I've been waiting long enough.""
5230	
5230	And he came down the steps towards the tail of the cart as if to
5230	lay hands on the smaller crate.
5230	
5230	No sooner had Fearenside's dog caught sight of him, however, than
5230	it began to bristle and growl savagely, and when he rushed down the
5230	steps it gave an undecided hop, and then sprang straight at his
5230	hand. ""Whup!"" cried Hall, jumping back, for he was no hero with
5230	dogs, and Fearenside howled, ""Lie down!"" and snatched his whip.
5230	
5230	They saw the dog's teeth had slipped the hand, heard a kick, saw the
5230	dog execute a flanking jump and get home on the stranger's leg, and
5230	heard the rip of his trousering. Then the finer end of Fearenside's
5230	whip reached his property, and the dog, yelping with dismay,
5230	retreated under the wheels of the waggon. It was all the business of
5230	a swift half-minute. No one spoke, everyone shouted. The stranger
5230	glanced swiftly at his torn glove and at his leg, made as if he
5230	would stoop to the latter, then turned and rushed swiftly up the
5230	steps into the inn. They heard him go headlong across the passage
5230	and up the uncarpeted stairs to his bedroom.
5230	
5230	""You brute, you!"" said Fearenside, climbing off the waggon with his
5230	whip in his hand, while the dog watched him through the wheel.
5230	""Come here,"" said Fearenside--""You'd better.""
5230	
5230	Hall had stood gaping. ""He wuz bit,"" said Hall. ""I'd better go and
5230	see to en,"" and he trotted after the stranger. He met Mrs. Hall in
5230	the passage. ""Carrier's darg,"" he said ""bit en.""
5230	
5230	He went straight upstairs, and the stranger's door being ajar, he
5230	pushed it open and was entering without any ceremony, being of a
5230	naturally sympathetic turn of mind.
5230	
5230	The blind was down and the room dim. He caught a glimpse of a most
5230	singular thing, what seemed a handless arm waving towards him, and
5230	a face of three huge indeterminate spots on white, very like the
5230	face of a pale pansy. Then he was struck violently in the chest,
5230	hurled back, and the door slammed in his face and locked. It was so
5230	rapid that it gave him no time to observe. A waving of indecipherable
5230	shapes, a blow, and a concussion. There he stood on the dark little
5230	landing, wondering what it might be that he had seen.
5230	
5230	A couple of minutes after, he rejoined the little group that had
5230	formed outside the ""Coach and Horses."" There was Fearenside telling
5230	about it all over again for the second time; there was Mrs. Hall
5230	saying his dog didn't have no business to bite her guests; there
5230	was Huxter, the general dealer from over the road, interrogative;
5230	and Sandy Wadgers from the forge, judicial; besides women and
5230	children, all of them saying fatuities: ""Wouldn't let en bite
5230	_me_, I knows""; ""'Tasn't right _have_ such dargs""; ""Whad _'e_ bite
5230	'n for, then?"" and so forth.
5230	
5230	Mr. Hall, staring at them from the steps and listening, found it
5230	incredible that he had seen anything so very remarkable happen
5230	upstairs. Besides, his vocabulary was altogether too limited to
5230	express his impressions.
5230	
5230	""He don't want no help, he says,"" he said in answer to his wife's
5230	inquiry. ""We'd better be a-takin' of his luggage in.""
5230	
5230	""He ought to have it cauterised at once,"" said Mr. Huxter;
5230	""especially if it's at all inflamed.""
5230	
5230	""I'd shoot en, that's what I'd do,"" said a lady in the group.
5230	
5230	Suddenly the dog began growling again.
5230	
5230	""Come along,"" cried an angry voice in the doorway, and there stood
5230	the muffled stranger with his collar turned up, and his hat-brim
5230	bent down. ""The sooner you get those things in the better I'll be
5230	pleased."" It is stated by an anonymous bystander that his trousers
5230	and gloves had been changed.
5230	
5230	""Was you hurt, sir?"" said Fearenside. ""I'm rare sorry the darg--""
5230	
5230	""Not a bit,"" said the stranger. ""Never broke the skin. Hurry up
5230	with those things.""
5230	
5230	He then swore to himself, so Mr. Hall asserts.
5230	
5230	Directly the first crate was, in accordance with his directions,
5230	carried into the parlour, the stranger flung himself upon it with
5230	extraordinary eagerness, and began to unpack it, scattering the
5230	straw with an utter disregard of Mrs. Hall's carpet. And from it he
5230	began to produce bottles--little fat bottles containing powders,
5230	small and slender bottles containing coloured and white fluids,
5230	fluted blue bottles labeled Poison, bottles with round bodies and
5230	slender necks, large green-glass bottles, large white-glass bottles,
5230	bottles with glass stoppers and frosted labels, bottles with fine
5230	corks, bottles with bungs, bottles with wooden caps, wine bottles,
5230	salad-oil bottles--putting them in rows on the chiffonnier, on the
5230	mantel, on the table under the window, round the floor, on the
5230	bookshelf--everywhere. The chemist's shop in Bramblehurst could not
5230	boast half so many. Quite a sight it was. Crate after crate yielded
5230	bottles, until all six were empty and the table high with straw; the
5230	only things that came out of these crates besides the bottles were
5230	a number of test-tubes and a carefully packed balance.
5230	
5230	And directly the crates were unpacked, the stranger went to the
5230	window and set to work, not troubling in the least about the litter
5230	of straw, the fire which had gone out, the box of books outside,
5230	nor for the trunks and other luggage that had gone upstairs.
5230	
5230	When Mrs. Hall took his dinner in to him, he was already so
5230	absorbed in his work, pouring little drops out of the bottles into
5230	test-tubes, that he did not hear her until she had swept away the
5230	bulk of the straw and put the tray on the table, with some little
5230	emphasis perhaps, seeing the state that the floor was in. Then he
5230	half turned his head and immediately turned it away again. But she
5230	saw he had removed his glasses; they were beside him on the table,
5230	and it seemed to her that his eye sockets were extraordinarily
5230	hollow. He put on his spectacles again, and then turned and faced
5230	her. She was about to complain of the straw on the floor when he
5230	anticipated her.
5230	
5230	""I wish you wouldn't come in without knocking,"" he said in the tone
5230	of abnormal exasperation that seemed so characteristic of him.
5230	
5230	""I knocked, but seemingly--""
5230	
5230	""Perhaps you did. But in my investigations--my really very urgent
5230	and necessary investigations--the slightest disturbance, the jar
5230	of a door--I must ask you--""
5230	
5230	""Certainly, sir. You can turn the lock if you're like that, you
5230	know. Any time.""
5230	
5230	""A very good idea,"" said the stranger.
5230	
5230	""This stror, sir, if I might make so bold as to remark--""
5230	
5230	""Don't. If the straw makes trouble put it down in the bill."" And he
5230	mumbled at her--words suspiciously like curses.
5230	
5230	He was so odd, standing there, so aggressive and explosive, bottle
5230	in one hand and test-tube in the other, that Mrs. Hall was quite
5230	alarmed. But she was a resolute woman. ""In which case, I should
5230	like to know, sir, what you consider--""
5230	
5230	""A shilling--put down a shilling. Surely a shilling's enough?""
5230	
5230	""So be it,"" said Mrs. Hall, taking up the table-cloth and beginning
5230	to spread it over the table. ""If you're satisfied, of course--""
5230	
5230	He turned and sat down, with his coat-collar toward her.
5230	
5230	All the afternoon he worked with the door locked and, as Mrs. Hall
5230	testifies, for the most part in silence. But once there was a
5230	concussion and a sound of bottles ringing together as though the
5230	table had been hit, and the smash of a bottle flung violently down,
5230	and then a rapid pacing athwart the room. Fearing ""something was
5230	the matter,"" she went to the door and listened, not caring to
5230	knock.
5230	
5230	""I can't go on,"" he was raving. ""I _can't_ go on. Three hundred
5230	thousand, four hundred thousand! The huge multitude! Cheated! All
5230	my life it may take me! ... Patience! Patience indeed! ... Fool!
5230	fool!""
5230	
5230	There was a noise of hobnails on the bricks in the bar, and Mrs.
5230	Hall had very reluctantly to leave the rest of his soliloquy.
5230	When she returned the room was silent again, save for the faint
5230	crepitation of his chair and the occasional clink of a bottle.
5230	It was all over; the stranger had resumed work.
5230	
5230	When she took in his tea she saw broken glass in the corner of the
5230	room under the concave mirror, and a golden stain that had been
5230	carelessly wiped. She called attention to it.
5230	
5230	""Put it down in the bill,"" snapped her visitor. ""For God's sake
5230	don't worry me. If there's damage done, put it down in the bill,""
5230	and he went on ticking a list in the exercise book before him.
5230	
5230	""I'll tell you something,"" said Fearenside, mysteriously. It was
5230	late in the afternoon, and they were in the little beer-shop of
5230	Iping Hanger.
5230	
5230	""Well?"" said Teddy Henfrey.
5230	
5230	""This chap you're speaking of, what my dog bit. Well--he's black.
5230	Leastways, his legs are. I seed through the tear of his trousers
5230	and the tear of his glove. You'd have expected a sort of pinky to
5230	show, wouldn't you? Well--there wasn't none. Just blackness. I
5230	tell you, he's as black as my hat.""
5230	
5230	""My sakes!"" said Henfrey. ""It's a rummy case altogether. Why, his
5230	nose is as pink as paint!""
5230	
5230	""That's true,"" said Fearenside. ""I knows that. And I tell 'ee what
5230	I'm thinking. That marn's a piebald, Teddy. Black here and white
5230	there--in patches. And he's ashamed of it. He's a kind of half-breed,
5230	and the colour's come off patchy instead of mixing. I've heard of
5230	such things before. And it's the common way with horses, as any one
5230	can see.""

5230	CHAPTER IV
5230	
5230	MR. CUSS INTERVIEWS THE STRANGER
5230	
5230	
5230	I have told the circumstances of the stranger's arrival in Iping
5230	with a certain fulness of detail, in order that the curious
5230	impression he created may be understood by the reader. But
5230	excepting two odd incidents, the circumstances of his stay until
5230	the extraordinary day of the club festival may be passed over very
5230	cursorily. There were a number of skirmishes with Mrs. Hall on
5230	matters of domestic discipline, but in every case until late April,
5230	when the first signs of penury began, he over-rode her by the easy
5230	expedient of an extra payment. Hall did not like him, and whenever
5230	he dared he talked of the advisability of getting rid of him; but
5230	he showed his dislike chiefly by concealing it ostentatiously, and
5230	avoiding his visitor as much as possible. ""Wait till the summer,""
5230	said Mrs. Hall sagely, ""when the artisks are beginning to come.
5230	Then we'll see. He may be a bit overbearing, but bills settled
5230	punctual is bills settled punctual, whatever you'd like to say.""
5230	
5230	The stranger did not go to church, and indeed made no difference
5230	between Sunday and the irreligious days, even in costume. He
5230	worked, as Mrs. Hall thought, very fitfully. Some days he would
5230	come down early and be continuously busy. On others he would rise
5230	late, pace his room, fretting audibly for hours together, smoke,
5230	sleep in the armchair by the fire. Communication with the world
5230	beyond the village he had none. His temper continued very
5230	uncertain; for the most part his manner was that of a man suffering
5230	under almost unendurable provocation, and once or twice things were
5230	snapped, torn, crushed, or broken in spasmodic gusts of violence.
5230	He seemed under a chronic irritation of the greatest intensity. His
5230	habit of talking to himself in a low voice grew steadily upon him,
5230	but though Mrs. Hall listened conscientiously she could make
5230	neither head nor tail of what she heard.
5230	
5230	He rarely went abroad by daylight, but at twilight he would go out
5230	muffled up invisibly, whether the weather were cold or not, and he
5230	chose the loneliest paths and those most overshadowed by trees and
5230	banks. His goggling spectacles and ghastly bandaged face under the
5230	penthouse of his hat, came with a disagreeable suddenness out of
5230	the darkness upon one or two home-going labourers, and Teddy
5230	Henfrey, tumbling out of the ""Scarlet Coat"" one night, at half-past
5230	nine, was scared shamefully by the stranger's skull-like head (he
5230	was walking hat in hand) lit by the sudden light of the opened inn
5230	door. Such children as saw him at nightfall dreamt of bogies, and
5230	it seemed doubtful whether he disliked boys more than they disliked
5230	him, or the reverse; but there was certainly a vivid enough dislike
5230	on either side.
5230	
5230	It was inevitable that a person of so remarkable an appearance and
5230	bearing should form a frequent topic in such a village as Iping.
5230	Opinion was greatly divided about his occupation. Mrs. Hall was
5230	sensitive on the point. When questioned, she explained very
5230	carefully that he was an ""experimental investigator,"" going
5230	gingerly over the syllables as one who dreads pitfalls. When asked
5230	what an experimental investigator was, she would say with a touch
5230	of superiority that most educated people knew such things as that,
5230	and would thus explain that he ""discovered things."" Her visitor had
5230	had an accident, she said, which temporarily discoloured his face
5230	and hands, and being of a sensitive disposition, he was averse to
5230	any public notice of the fact.
5230	
5230	Out of her hearing there was a view largely entertained that he was
5230	a criminal trying to escape from justice by wrapping himself up so
5230	as to conceal himself altogether from the eye of the police. This
5230	idea sprang from the brain of Mr. Teddy Henfrey. No crime of any
5230	magnitude dating from the middle or end of February was known to
5230	have occurred. Elaborated in the imagination of Mr. Gould, the
5230	probationary assistant in the National School, this theory took the
5230	form that the stranger was an Anarchist in disguise, preparing
5230	explosives, and he resolved to undertake such detective operations
5230	as his time permitted. These consisted for the most part in looking
5230	very hard at the stranger whenever they met, or in asking people
5230	who had never seen the stranger, leading questions about him. But
5230	he detected nothing.
5230	
5230	Another school of opinion followed Mr. Fearenside, and either
5230	accepted the piebald view or some modification of it; as, for
5230	instance, Silas Durgan, who was heard to assert that ""if he chooses
5230	to show enself at fairs he'd make his fortune in no time,"" and
5230	being a bit of a theologian, compared the stranger to the man with
5230	the one talent. Yet another view explained the entire matter by
5230	regarding the stranger as a harmless lunatic. That had the
5230	advantage of accounting for everything straight away.
5230	
5230	Between these main groups there were waverers and compromisers.
5230	Sussex folk have few superstitions, and it was only after the
5230	events of early April that the thought of the supernatural was
5230	first whispered in the village. Even then it was only credited
5230	among the women folk.
5230	
5230	But whatever they thought of him, people in Iping, on the whole,
5230	agreed in disliking him. His irritability, though it might have
5230	been comprehensible to an urban brain-worker, was an amazing thing
5230	to these quiet Sussex villagers. The frantic gesticulations they
5230	surprised now and then, the headlong pace after nightfall that
5230	swept him upon them round quiet corners, the inhuman bludgeoning
5230	of all tentative advances of curiosity, the taste for twilight
5230	that led to the closing of doors, the pulling down of blinds,
5230	the extinction of candles and lamps--who could agree with such
5230	goings on? They drew aside as he passed down the village, and when
5230	he had gone by, young humourists would up with coat-collars and
5230	down with hat-brims, and go pacing nervously after him in imitation
5230	of his occult bearing. There was a song popular at that time called
5230	""The Bogey Man"". Miss Statchell sang it at the schoolroom concert
5230	(in aid of the church lamps), and thereafter whenever one or two of
5230	the villagers were gathered together and the stranger appeared, a
5230	bar or so of this tune, more or less sharp or flat, was whistled in
5230	the midst of them. Also belated little children would call ""Bogey
5230	Man!"" after him, and make off tremulously elated.
5230	
5230	Cuss, the general practitioner, was devoured by curiosity. The
5230	bandages excited his professional interest, the report of the
5230	thousand and one bottles aroused his jealous regard. All through
5230	April and May he coveted an opportunity of talking to the stranger,
5230	and at last, towards Whitsuntide, he could stand it no longer, but
5230	hit upon the subscription-list for a village nurse as an excuse. He
5230	was surprised to find that Mr. Hall did not know his guest's name.
5230	""He give a name,"" said Mrs. Hall--an assertion which was quite
5230	unfounded--""but I didn't rightly hear it."" She thought it seemed
5230	so silly not to know the man's name.
5230	
5230	Cuss rapped at the parlour door and entered. There was a fairly
5230	audible imprecation from within. ""Pardon my intrusion,"" said Cuss,
5230	and then the door closed and cut Mrs. Hall off from the rest of
5230	the conversation.
5230	
5230	She could hear the murmur of voices for the next ten minutes, then
5230	a cry of surprise, a stirring of feet, a chair flung aside, a bark
5230	of laughter, quick steps to the door, and Cuss appeared, his face
5230	white, his eyes staring over his shoulder. He left the door open
5230	behind him, and without looking at her strode across the hall and
5230	went down the steps, and she heard his feet hurrying along the
5230	road. He carried his hat in his hand. She stood behind the door,
5230	looking at the open door of the parlour. Then she heard the
5230	stranger laughing quietly, and then his footsteps came across the
5230	room. She could not see his face where she stood. The parlour door
5230	slammed, and the place was silent again.
5230	
5230	Cuss went straight up the village to Bunting the vicar. ""Am I mad?""
5230	Cuss began abruptly, as he entered the shabby little study. ""Do I
5230	look like an insane person?""
5230	
5230	""What's happened?"" said the vicar, putting the ammonite on the
5230	loose sheets of his forth-coming sermon.
5230	
5230	""That chap at the inn--""
5230	
5230	""Well?""
5230	
5230	""Give me something to drink,"" said Cuss, and he sat down.
5230	
5230	When his nerves had been steadied by a glass of cheap sherry--the
5230	only drink the good vicar had available--he told him of the
5230	interview he had just had. ""Went in,"" he gasped, ""and began to
5230	demand a subscription for that Nurse Fund. He'd stuck his hands in
5230	his pockets as I came in, and he sat down lumpily in his chair.
5230	Sniffed. I told him I'd heard he took an interest in scientific
5230	things. He said yes. Sniffed again. Kept on sniffing all the time;
5230	evidently recently caught an infernal cold. No wonder, wrapped up
5230	like that! I developed the nurse idea, and all the while kept my
5230	eyes open. Bottles--chemicals--everywhere. Balance, test-tubes
5230	in stands, and a smell of--evening primrose. Would he subscribe?
5230	Said he'd consider it. Asked him, point-blank, was he researching.
5230	Said he was. A long research? Got quite cross. 'A damnable long
5230	research,' said he, blowing the cork out, so to speak. 'Oh,' said
5230	I. And out came the grievance. The man was just on the boil, and my
5230	question boiled him over. He had been given a prescription, most
5230	valuable prescription--what for he wouldn't say. Was it medical?
5230	'Damn you! What are you fishing after?' I apologised. Dignified
5230	sniff and cough. He resumed. He'd read it. Five ingredients. Put it
5230	down; turned his head. Draught of air from window lifted the paper.
5230	Swish, rustle. He was working in a room with an open fireplace, he
5230	said. Saw a flicker, and there was the prescription burning and
5230	lifting chimneyward. Rushed towards it just as it whisked up the
5230	chimney. So! Just at that point, to illustrate his story, out came
5230	his arm.""
5230	
5230	""Well?""
5230	
5230	""No hand--just an empty sleeve. Lord! I thought, _that's_ a
5230	deformity! Got a cork arm, I suppose, and has taken it off. Then, I
5230	thought, there's something odd in that. What the devil keeps that
5230	sleeve up and open, if there's nothing in it? There was nothing in
5230	it, I tell you. Nothing down it, right down to the joint. I could
5230	see right down it to the elbow, and there was a glimmer of light
5230	shining through a tear of the cloth. 'Good God!' I said. Then he
5230	stopped. Stared at me with those black goggles of his, and then
5230	at his sleeve.""
5230	
5230	""Well?""
5230	
5230	""That's all. He never said a word; just glared, and put his sleeve
5230	back in his pocket quickly. 'I was saying,' said he, 'that there
5230	was the prescription burning, wasn't I?' Interrogative cough.
5230	'How the devil,' said I, 'can you move an empty sleeve like that?'
5230	'Empty sleeve?' 'Yes,' said I, 'an empty sleeve.'
5230	
5230	""'It's an empty sleeve, is it? You saw it was an empty sleeve?' He
5230	stood up right away. I stood up too. He came towards me in three
5230	very slow steps, and stood quite close. Sniffed venomously. I
5230	didn't flinch, though I'm hanged if that bandaged knob of his, and
5230	those blinkers, aren't enough to unnerve any one, coming quietly
5230	up to you.
5230	
5230	""'You said it was an empty sleeve?' he said. 'Certainly,' I said.
5230	At staring and saying nothing a barefaced man, unspectacled, starts
5230	scratch. Then very quietly he pulled his sleeve out of his pocket
5230	again, and raised his arm towards me as though he would show it to
5230	me again. He did it very, very slowly. I looked at it. Seemed an
5230	age. 'Well?' said I, clearing my throat, 'there's nothing in it.'
5230	
5230	""Had to say something. I was beginning to feel frightened. I could
5230	see right down it. He extended it straight towards me, slowly,
5230	slowly--just like that--until the cuff was six inches from my
5230	face. Queer thing to see an empty sleeve come at you like that!
5230	And then--""
5230	
5230	""Well?""
5230	
5230	""Something--exactly like a finger and thumb it felt--nipped my
5230	nose.""
5230	
5230	Bunting began to laugh.
5230	
5230	""There wasn't anything there!"" said Cuss, his voice running up into
5230	a shriek at the ""there."" ""It's all very well for you to laugh, but
5230	I tell you I was so startled, I hit his cuff hard, and turned
5230	around, and cut out of the room--I left him--""
5230	
5230	Cuss stopped. There was no mistaking the sincerity of his panic.
5230	He turned round in a helpless way and took a second glass of the
5230	excellent vicar's very inferior sherry. ""When I hit his cuff,"" said
5230	Cuss, ""I tell you, it felt exactly like hitting an arm. And there
5230	wasn't an arm! There wasn't the ghost of an arm!""
5230	
5230	Mr. Bunting thought it over. He looked suspiciously at Cuss. ""It's
5230	a most remarkable story,"" he said. He looked very wise and grave
5230	indeed. ""It's really,"" said Mr. Bunting with judicial emphasis, ""a
5230	most remarkable story.""
5230	
5230	
5230	
5230	CHAPTER V
5230	
5230	THE BURGLARY AT THE VICARAGE
5230	
5230	
5230	The facts of the burglary at the vicarage came to us chiefly
5230	through the medium of the vicar and his wife. It occurred in the
5230	small hours of Whit Monday, the day devoted in Iping to the Club
5230	festivities. Mrs. Bunting, it seems, woke up suddenly in the
5230	stillness that comes before the dawn, with the strong impression
5230	that the door of their bedroom had opened and closed. She did not
5230	arouse her husband at first, but sat up in bed listening. She then
5230	distinctly heard the pad, pad, pad of bare feet coming out of the
5230	adjoining dressing-room and walking along the passage towards the
5230	staircase. As soon as she felt assured of this, she aroused the
5230	Rev. Mr. Bunting as quietly as possible. He did not strike a light,
5230	but putting on his spectacles, her dressing-gown and his bath
5230	slippers, he went out on the landing to listen. He heard quite
5230	distinctly a fumbling going on at his study desk down-stairs, and
5230	then a violent sneeze.
5230	
5230	At that he returned to his bedroom, armed himself with the most
5230	obvious weapon, the poker, and descended the staircase as
5230	noiselessly as possible. Mrs. Bunting came out on the landing.
5230	
5230	The hour was about four, and the ultimate darkness of the night was
5230	past. There was a faint shimmer of light in the hall, but the study
5230	doorway yawned impenetrably black. Everything was still except the
5230	faint creaking of the stairs under Mr. Bunting's tread, and the
5230	slight movements in the study. Then something snapped, the drawer
5230	was opened, and there was a rustle of papers. Then came an
5230	imprecation, and a match was struck and the study was flooded with
5230	yellow light. Mr. Bunting was now in the hall, and through the
5230	crack of the door he could see the desk and the open drawer and a
5230	candle burning on the desk. But the robber he could not see. He
5230	stood there in the hall undecided what to do, and Mrs. Bunting, her
5230	face white and intent, crept slowly downstairs after him. One thing
5230	kept Mr. Bunting's courage; the persuasion that this burglar was a
5230	resident in the village.
5230	
5230	They heard the chink of money, and realised that the robber had
5230	found the housekeeping reserve of gold--two pounds ten in half
5230	sovereigns altogether. At that sound Mr. Bunting was nerved to
5230	abrupt action. Gripping the poker firmly, he rushed into the room,
5230	closely followed by Mrs. Bunting. ""Surrender!"" cried Mr. Bunting,
5230	fiercely, and then stooped amazed. Apparently the room was
5230	perfectly empty.
5230	
5230	Yet their conviction that they had, that very moment, heard somebody
5230	moving in the room had amounted to a certainty. For half a minute,
5230	perhaps, they stood gaping, then Mrs. Bunting went across the room
5230	and looked behind the screen, while Mr. Bunting, by a kindred
5230	impulse, peered under the desk. Then Mrs. Bunting turned back the
5230	window-curtains, and Mr. Bunting looked up the chimney and probed it
5230	with the poker. Then Mrs. Bunting scrutinised the waste-paper basket
5230	and Mr. Bunting opened the lid of the coal-scuttle. Then they came
5230	to a stop and stood with eyes interrogating each other.
5230	
5230	""I could have sworn--"" said Mr. Bunting.
5230	
5230	""The candle!"" said Mr. Bunting. ""Who lit the candle?""
5230	
5230	""The drawer!"" said Mrs. Bunting. ""And the money's gone!""
5230	
5230	She went hastily to the doorway.
5230	
5230	""Of all the strange occurrences--""
5230	
5230	There was a violent sneeze in the passage. They rushed out, and as
5230	they did so the kitchen door slammed. ""Bring the candle,"" said Mr.
5230	Bunting, and led the way. They both heard a sound of bolts being
5230	hastily shot back.
5230	
5230	As he opened the kitchen door he saw through the scullery that
5230	the back door was just opening, and the faint light of early dawn
5230	displayed the dark masses of the garden beyond. He is certain that
5230	nothing went out of the door. It opened, stood open for a moment,
5230	and then closed with a slam. As it did so, the candle Mrs. Bunting
5230	was carrying from the study flickered and flared. It was a minute
5230	or more before they entered the kitchen.
5230	
5230	The place was empty. They refastened the back door, examined the
5230	kitchen, pantry, and scullery thoroughly, and at last went down
5230	into the cellar. There was not a soul to be found in the house,
5230	search as they would.
5230	
5230	Daylight found the vicar and his wife, a quaintly-costumed little
5230	couple, still marvelling about on their own ground floor by the
5230	unnecessary light of a guttering candle.
5230	
5230	
5230	
5230	CHAPTER VI
5230	
5230	THE FURNITURE THAT WENT MAD
5230	
5230	
5230	Now it happened that in the early hours of Whit Monday, before
5230	Millie was hunted out for the day, Mr. Hall and Mrs. Hall both rose
5230	and went noiselessly down into the cellar. Their business there was
5230	of a private nature, and had something to do with the specific
5230	gravity of their beer. They had hardly entered the cellar when Mrs.
5230	Hall found she had forgotten to bring down a bottle of sarsaparilla
5230	from their joint-room. As she was the expert and principal operator
5230	in this affair, Hall very properly went upstairs for it.
5230	
5230	On the landing he was surprised to see that the stranger's door was
5230	ajar. He went on into his own room and found the bottle as he had
5230	been directed.
5230	
5230	But returning with the bottle, he noticed that the bolts of the
5230	front door had been shot back, that the door was in fact simply on
5230	the latch. And with a flash of inspiration he connected this with
5230	the stranger's room upstairs and the suggestions of Mr. Teddy
5230	Henfrey. He distinctly remembered holding the candle while Mrs.
5230	Hall shot these bolts overnight. At the sight he stopped, gaping,
5230	then with the bottle still in his hand went upstairs again. He
5230	rapped at the stranger's door. There was no answer. He rapped
5230	again; then pushed the door wide open and entered.
5230	
5230	It was as he expected. The bed, the room also, was empty. And what
5230	was stranger, even to his heavy intelligence, on the bedroom chair
5230	and along the rail of the bed were scattered the garments, the only
5230	garments so far as he knew, and the bandages of their guest. His
5230	big slouch hat even was cocked jauntily over the bed-post.
5230	
5230	As Hall stood there he heard his wife's voice coming out of the
5230	depth of the cellar, with that rapid telescoping of the syllables
5230	and interrogative cocking up of the final words to a high note,
5230	by which the West Sussex villager is wont to indicate a brisk
5230	impatience. ""George! You gart whad a wand?""
5230	
5230	At that he turned and hurried down to her. ""Janny,"" he said, over
5230	the rail of the cellar steps, ""'tas the truth what Henfrey sez.
5230	'E's not in uz room, 'e en't. And the front door's onbolted.""
5230	
5230	At first Mrs. Hall did not understand, and as soon as she did she
5230	resolved to see the empty room for herself. Hall, still holding the
5230	bottle, went first. ""If 'e en't there,"" he said, ""'is close are.
5230	And what's 'e doin' 'ithout 'is close, then? 'Tas a most curious
5230	business.""
5230	
5230	As they came up the cellar steps they both, it was afterwards
5230	ascertained, fancied they heard the front door open and shut, but
5230	seeing it closed and nothing there, neither said a word to the other
5230	about it at the time. Mrs. Hall passed her husband in the passage
5230	and ran on first upstairs. Someone sneezed on the staircase. Hall,
5230	following six steps behind, thought that he heard her sneeze. She,
5230	going on first, was under the impression that Hall was sneezing.
5230	She flung open the door and stood regarding the room. ""Of all the
5230	curious!"" she said.
5230	
5230	She heard a sniff close behind her head as it seemed, and turning,
5230	was surprised to see Hall a dozen feet off on the topmost stair.
5230	But in another moment he was beside her. She bent forward and put
5230	her hand on the pillow and then under the clothes.
5230	
5230	""Cold,"" she said. ""He's been up this hour or more.""
5230	
5230	As she did so, a most extraordinary thing happened. The bed-clothes
5230	gathered themselves together, leapt up suddenly into a sort of peak,
5230	and then jumped headlong over the bottom rail. It was exactly as if
5230	a hand had clutched them in the centre and flung them aside.
5230	Immediately after, the stranger's hat hopped off the bed-post,
5230	described a whirling flight in the air through the better part of
5230	a circle, and then dashed straight at Mrs. Hall's face. Then as
5230	swiftly came the sponge from the washstand; and then the chair,
5230	flinging the stranger's coat and trousers carelessly aside, and
5230	laughing drily in a voice singularly like the stranger's, turned
5230	itself up with its four legs at Mrs. Hall, seemed to take aim at her
5230	for a moment, and charged at her. She screamed and turned, and then
5230	the chair legs came gently but firmly against her back and impelled
5230	her and Hall out of the room. The door slammed violently and was
5230	locked. The chair and bed seemed to be executing a dance of triumph
5230	for a moment, and then abruptly everything was still.
5230	
5230	Mrs. Hall was left almost in a fainting condition in Mr. Hall's
5230	arms on the landing. It was with the greatest difficulty that Mr.
5230	Hall and Millie, who had been roused by her scream of alarm,
5230	succeeded in getting her downstairs, and applying the restoratives
5230	customary in such cases.
5230	
5230	""'Tas sperits,"" said Mrs. Hall. ""I know 'tas sperits. I've read in
5230	papers of en. Tables and chairs leaping and dancing...""
5230	
5230	""Take a drop more, Janny,"" said Hall. ""'Twill steady ye.""
5230	
5230	""Lock him out,"" said Mrs. Hall. ""Don't let him come in again.
5230	I half guessed--I might ha' known. With them goggling eyes and
5230	bandaged head, and never going to church of a Sunday. And all
5230	they bottles--more'n it's right for any one to have. He's put the
5230	sperits into the furniture.... My good old furniture! 'Twas in
5230	that very chair my poor dear mother used to sit when I was a
5230	little girl. To think it should rise up against me now!""
5230	
5230	""Just a drop more, Janny,"" said Hall. ""Your nerves is all upset.""
5230	
5230	They sent Millie across the street through the golden five o'clock
5230	sunshine to rouse up Mr. Sandy Wadgers, the blacksmith. Mr.
5230	Hall's compliments and the furniture upstairs was behaving most
5230	extraordinary. Would Mr. Wadgers come round? He was a knowing man,
5230	was Mr. Wadgers, and very resourceful. He took quite a grave view
5230	of the case. ""Arm darmed if thet ent witchcraft,"" was the view of
5230	Mr. Sandy Wadgers. ""You warnt horseshoes for such gentry as he.""
5230	
5230	He came round greatly concerned. They wanted him to lead the way
5230	upstairs to the room, but he didn't seem to be in any hurry. He
5230	preferred to talk in the passage. Over the way Huxter's apprentice
5230	came out and began taking down the shutters of the tobacco window.
5230	He was called over to join the discussion. Mr. Huxter naturally
5230	followed over in the course of a few minutes. The Anglo-Saxon
5230	genius for parliamentary government asserted itself; there was a
5230	great deal of talk and no decisive action. ""Let's have the facts
5230	first,"" insisted Mr. Sandy Wadgers. ""Let's be sure we'd be acting
5230	perfectly right in bustin' that there door open. A door onbust is
5230	always open to bustin', but ye can't onbust a door once you've
5230	busted en.""
5230	
5230	And suddenly and most wonderfully the door of the room upstairs
5230	opened of its own accord, and as they looked up in amazement,
5230	they saw descending the stairs the muffled figure of the stranger
5230	staring more blackly and blankly than ever with those unreasonably
5230	large blue glass eyes of his. He came down stiffly and slowly,
5230	staring all the time; he walked across the passage staring, then
5230	stopped.
5230	
5230	""Look there!"" he said, and their eyes followed the direction of his
5230	gloved finger and saw a bottle of sarsaparilla hard by the cellar
5230	door. Then he entered the parlour, and suddenly, swiftly,
5230	viciously, slammed the door in their faces.
5230	
5230	Not a word was spoken until the last echoes of the slam had died
5230	away. They stared at one another. ""Well, if that don't lick
5230	everything!"" said Mr. Wadgers, and left the alternative unsaid.
5230	
5230	""I'd go in and ask'n 'bout it,"" said Wadgers, to Mr. Hall. ""I'd
5230	d'mand an explanation.""
5230	
5230	It took some time to bring the landlady's husband up to that pitch.
5230	At last he rapped, opened the door, and got as far as, ""Excuse me--""
5230	
5230	""Go to the devil!"" said the stranger in a tremendous voice, and
5230	""Shut that door after you."" So that brief interview terminated.
5230

5230	CHAPTER VII
5230	
5230	THE UNVEILING OF THE STRANGER
5230	
5230	
5230	The stranger went into the little parlour of the ""Coach and Horses""
5230	about half-past five in the morning, and there he remained until
5230	near midday, the blinds down, the door shut, and none, after Hall's
5230	repulse, venturing near him.
5230	
5230	All that time he must have fasted. Thrice he rang his bell, the
5230	third time furiously and continuously, but no one answered him.
5230	""Him and his 'go to the devil' indeed!"" said Mrs. Hall. Presently
5230	came an imperfect rumour of the burglary at the vicarage, and two
5230	and two were put together. Hall, assisted by Wadgers, went off to
5230	find Mr. Shuckleforth, the magistrate, and take his advice. No one
5230	ventured upstairs. How the stranger occupied himself is unknown.
5230	Now and then he would stride violently up and down, and twice came
5230	an outburst of curses, a tearing of paper, and a violent smashing
5230	of bottles.
5230	
5230	The little group of scared but curious people increased. Mrs. Huxter
5230	came over; some gay young fellows resplendent in black ready-made
5230	jackets and _pique_ paper ties--for it was Whit Monday--joined
5230	the group with confused interrogations. Young Archie Harker
5230	distinguished himself by going up the yard and trying to peep
5230	under the window-blinds. He could see nothing, but gave reason
5230	for supposing that he did, and others of the Iping youth
5230	presently joined him.
5230	
5230	It was the finest of all possible Whit Mondays, and down the
5230	village street stood a row of nearly a dozen booths, a shooting
5230	gallery, and on the grass by the forge were three yellow and
5230	chocolate waggons and some picturesque strangers of both sexes
5230	putting up a cocoanut shy. The gentlemen wore blue jerseys, the
5230	ladies white aprons and quite fashionable hats with heavy plumes.
5230	Wodger, of the ""Purple Fawn,"" and Mr. Jaggers, the cobbler, who
5230	also sold old second-hand ordinary bicycles, were stretching a
5230	string of union-jacks and royal ensigns (which had originally
5230	celebrated the first Victorian Jubilee) across the road.
5230	
5230	And inside, in the artificial darkness of the parlour, into which
5230	only one thin jet of sunlight penetrated, the stranger, hungry we
5230	must suppose, and fearful, hidden in his uncomfortable hot wrappings,
5230	pored through his dark glasses upon his paper or chinked his dirty
5230	little bottles, and occasionally swore savagely at the boys, audible
5230	if invisible, outside the windows. In the corner by the fireplace
5230	lay the fragments of half a dozen smashed bottles, and a pungent
5230	twang of chlorine tainted the air. So much we know from what was
5230	heard at the time and from what was subsequently seen in the room.
5230	
5230	About noon he suddenly opened his parlour door and stood glaring
5230	fixedly at the three or four people in the bar. ""Mrs. Hall,"" he
5230	said. Somebody went sheepishly and called for Mrs. Hall.
5230	
5230	Mrs. Hall appeared after an interval, a little short of breath, but
5230	all the fiercer for that. Hall was still out. She had deliberated
5230	over this scene, and she came holding a little tray with an
5230	unsettled bill upon it. ""Is it your bill you're wanting, sir?"" she
5230	said.
5230	
5230	""Why wasn't my breakfast laid? Why haven't you prepared my meals
5230	and answered my bell? Do you think I live without eating?""
5230	
5230	""Why isn't my bill paid?"" said Mrs. Hall. ""That's what I want to
5230	know.""
5230	
5230	""I told you three days ago I was awaiting a remittance--""
5230	
5230	""I told you two days ago I wasn't going to await no remittances.
5230	You can't grumble if your breakfast waits a bit, if my bill's been
5230	waiting these five days, can you?""
5230	
5230	The stranger swore briefly but vividly.
5230	
5230	""Nar, nar!"" from the bar.
5230	
5230	""And I'd thank you kindly, sir, if you'd keep your swearing to
5230	yourself, sir,"" said Mrs. Hall.
5230	
5230	The stranger stood looking more like an angry diving-helmet than
5230	ever. It was universally felt in the bar that Mrs. Hall had the
5230	better of him. His next words showed as much.
5230	
5230	""Look here, my good woman--"" he began.
5230	
5230	""Don't 'good woman' _me_,"" said Mrs. Hall.
5230	
5230	""I've told you my remittance hasn't come.""
5230	
5230	""Remittance indeed!"" said Mrs. Hall.
5230	
5230	""Still, I daresay in my pocket--""
5230	
5230	""You told me three days ago that you hadn't anything but a
5230	sovereign's worth of silver upon you.""
5230	
5230	""Well, I've found some more--""
5230	
5230	""'Ul-lo!"" from the bar.
5230	
5230	""I wonder where you found it,"" said Mrs. Hall.
5230	
5230	That seemed to annoy the stranger very much. He stamped his foot.
5230	""What do you mean?"" he said.
5230	
5230	""That I wonder where you found it,"" said Mrs. Hall. ""And before I
5230	take any bills or get any breakfasts, or do any such things
5230	whatsoever, you got to tell me one or two things I don't understand,
5230	and what nobody don't understand, and what everybody is very anxious
5230	to understand. I want to know what you been doing t'my chair
5230	upstairs, and I want to know how 'tis your room was empty, and how
5230	you got in again. Them as stops in this house comes in by the
5230	doors--that's the rule of the house, and that you _didn't_ do, and
5230	what I want to know is how you _did_ come in. And I want to know--""
5230	
5230	Suddenly the stranger raised his gloved hands clenched, stamped his
5230	foot, and said, ""Stop!"" with such extraordinary violence that he
5230	silenced her instantly.
5230	
5230	""You don't understand,"" he said, ""who I am or what I am. I'll show
5230	you. By Heaven! I'll show you."" Then he put his open palm over his
5230	face and withdrew it. The centre of his face became a black cavity.
5230	""Here,"" he said. He stepped forward and handed Mrs. Hall something
5230	which she, staring at his metamorphosed face, accepted automatically.
5230	Then, when she saw what it was, she screamed loudly, dropped it, and
5230	staggered back. The nose--it was the stranger's nose! pink and
5230	shining--rolled on the floor.
5230	
5230	Then he removed his spectacles, and everyone in the bar gasped. He
5230	took off his hat, and with a violent gesture tore at his whiskers
5230	and bandages. For a moment they resisted him. A flash of horrible
5230	anticipation passed through the bar. ""Oh, my Gard!"" said some one.
5230	Then off they came.
5230	
5230	It was worse than anything. Mrs. Hall, standing open-mouthed and
5230	horror-struck, shrieked at what she saw, and made for the door of
5230	the house. Everyone began to move. They were prepared for scars,
5230	disfigurements, tangible horrors, but nothing! The bandages and
5230	false hair flew across the passage into the bar, making a
5230	hobbledehoy jump to avoid them. Everyone tumbled on everyone else
5230	down the steps. For the man who stood there shouting some incoherent
5230	explanation, was a solid gesticulating figure up to the coat-collar
5230	of him, and then--nothingness, no visible thing at all!
5230	
5230	People down the village heard shouts and shrieks, and looking up
5230	the street saw the ""Coach and Horses"" violently firing out its
5230	humanity. They saw Mrs. Hall fall down and Mr. Teddy Henfrey jump
5230	to avoid tumbling over her, and then they heard the frightful
5230	screams of Millie, who, emerging suddenly from the kitchen at the
5230	noise of the tumult, had come upon the headless stranger from
5230	behind. These increased suddenly.
5230	
5230	Forthwith everyone all down the street, the sweetstuff seller,
5230	cocoanut shy proprietor and his assistant, the swing man, little
5230	boys and girls, rustic dandies, smart wenches, smocked elders
5230	and aproned gipsies--began running towards the inn, and in a
5230	miraculously short space of time a crowd of perhaps forty people,
5230	and rapidly increasing, swayed and hooted and inquired and
5230	exclaimed and suggested, in front of Mrs. Hall's establishment.
5230	Everyone seemed eager to talk at once, and the result was Babel. A
5230	small group supported Mrs. Hall, who was picked up in a state of
5230	collapse. There was a conference, and the incredible evidence of a
5230	vociferous eye-witness. ""O Bogey!"" ""What's he been doin', then?""
5230	""Ain't hurt the girl, 'as 'e?"" ""Run at en with a knife, I believe.""
5230	""No 'ed, I tell ye. I don't mean no manner of speaking. I mean _marn
5230	'ithout a 'ed_!"" ""Narnsense! 'tis some conjuring trick."" ""Fetched
5230	off 'is wrapping, 'e did--""
5230	
5230	In its struggles to see in through the open door, the crowd formed
5230	itself into a straggling wedge, with the more adventurous apex
5230	nearest the inn. ""He stood for a moment, I heerd the gal scream,
5230	and he turned. I saw her skirts whisk, and he went after her.
5230	Didn't take ten seconds. Back he comes with a knife in uz hand and
5230	a loaf; stood just as if he was staring. Not a moment ago. Went in
5230	that there door. I tell 'e, 'e ain't gart no 'ed at all. You just
5230	missed en--""
5230	
5230	There was a disturbance behind, and the speaker stopped to step
5230	aside for a little procession that was marching very resolutely
5230	towards the house; first Mr. Hall, very red and determined, then
5230	Mr. Bobby Jaffers, the village constable, and then the wary Mr.
5230	Wadgers. They had come now armed with a warrant.
5230	
5230	People shouted conflicting information of the recent circumstances.
5230	""'Ed or no 'ed,"" said Jaffers, ""I got to 'rest en, and 'rest en I
5230	_will_.""
5230	
5230	Mr. Hall marched up the steps, marched straight to the door of the
5230	parlour and flung it open. ""Constable,"" he said, ""do your duty.""
5230	
5230	Jaffers marched in. Hall next, Wadgers last. They saw in the dim
5230	light the headless figure facing them, with a gnawed crust of bread
5230	in one gloved hand and a chunk of cheese in the other.
5230	
5230	""That's him!"" said Hall.
5230	
5230	""What the devil's this?"" came in a tone of angry expostulation from
5230	above the collar of the figure.
5230	
5230	""You're a damned rum customer, mister,"" said Mr. Jaffers. ""But 'ed
5230	or no 'ed, the warrant says 'body,' and duty's duty--""
5230	
5230	""Keep off!"" said the figure, starting back.
5230	
5230	Abruptly he whipped down the bread and cheese, and Mr. Hall just
5230	grasped the knife on the table in time to save it. Off came the
5230	stranger's left glove and was slapped in Jaffers' face. In another
5230	moment Jaffers, cutting short some statement concerning a warrant,
5230	had gripped him by the handless wrist and caught his invisible
5230	throat. He got a sounding kick on the shin that made him shout, but
5230	he kept his grip. Hall sent the knife sliding along the table to
5230	Wadgers, who acted as goal-keeper for the offensive, so to speak,
5230	and then stepped forward as Jaffers and the stranger swayed and
5230	staggered towards him, clutching and hitting in. A chair stood in
5230	the way, and went aside with a crash as they came down together.
5230	
5230	""Get the feet,"" said Jaffers between his teeth.
5230	
5230	Mr. Hall, endeavouring to act on instructions, received a sounding
5230	kick in the ribs that disposed of him for a moment, and Mr.
5230	Wadgers, seeing the decapitated stranger had rolled over and got
5230	the upper side of Jaffers, retreated towards the door, knife in
5230	hand, and so collided with Mr. Huxter and the Sidderbridge carter
5230	coming to the rescue of law and order. At the same moment down came
5230	three or four bottles from the chiffonnier and shot a web of
5230	pungency into the air of the room.
5230	
5230	""I'll surrender,"" cried the stranger, though he had Jaffers down,
5230	and in another moment he stood up panting, a strange figure,
5230	headless and handless--for he had pulled off his right glove now
5230	as well as his left. ""It's no good,"" he said, as if sobbing for
5230	breath.
5230	
5230	It was the strangest thing in the world to hear that voice coming
5230	as if out of empty space, but the Sussex peasants are perhaps the
5230	most matter-of-fact people under the sun. Jaffers got up also and
5230	produced a pair of handcuffs. Then he stared.
5230	
5230	""I say!"" said Jaffers, brought up short by a dim realization of the
5230	incongruity of the whole business, ""Darn it! Can't use 'em as I can
5230	see.""
5230	
5230	The stranger ran his arm down his waistcoat, and as if by a miracle
5230	the buttons to which his empty sleeve pointed became undone. Then
5230	he said something about his shin, and stooped down. He seemed to be
5230	fumbling with his shoes and socks.
5230	
5230	""Why!"" said Huxter, suddenly, ""that's not a man at all. It's just
5230	empty clothes. Look! You can see down his collar and the linings of
5230	his clothes. I could put my arm--""
5230	
5230	He extended his hand; it seemed to meet something in mid-air, and
5230	he drew it back with a sharp exclamation. ""I wish you'd keep your
5230	fingers out of my eye,"" said the aerial voice, in a tone of savage
5230	expostulation. ""The fact is, I'm all here--head, hands, legs, and
5230	all the rest of it, but it happens I'm invisible. It's a confounded
5230	nuisance, but I am. That's no reason why I should be poked to
5230	pieces by every stupid bumpkin in Iping, is it?""
5230	
5230	The suit of clothes, now all unbuttoned and hanging loosely upon
5230	its unseen supports, stood up, arms akimbo.
5230	
5230	Several other of the men folks had now entered the room, so that it
5230	was closely crowded. ""Invisible, eh?"" said Huxter, ignoring the
5230	stranger's abuse. ""Who ever heard the likes of that?""
5230	
5230	""It's strange, perhaps, but it's not a crime. Why am I assaulted by
5230	a policeman in this fashion?""
5230	
5230	""Ah! that's a different matter,"" said Jaffers. ""No doubt you are a
5230	bit difficult to see in this light, but I got a warrant and it's
5230	all correct. What I'm after ain't no invisibility,--it's burglary.
5230	There's a house been broke into and money took.""
5230	
5230	""Well?""
5230	
5230	""And circumstances certainly point--""
5230	
5230	""Stuff and nonsense!"" said the Invisible Man.
5230	
5230	""I hope so, sir; but I've got my instructions.""
5230	
5230	""Well,"" said the stranger, ""I'll come. I'll _come_. But no
5230	handcuffs.""
5230	
5230	""It's the regular thing,"" said Jaffers.
5230	
5230	""No handcuffs,"" stipulated the stranger.
5230	
5230	""Pardon me,"" said Jaffers.
5230	
5230	Abruptly the figure sat down, and before any one could realise was
5230	was being done, the slippers, socks, and trousers had been kicked
5230	off under the table. Then he sprang up again and flung off his coat.
5230	
5230	""Here, stop that,"" said Jaffers, suddenly realising what was
5230	happening. He gripped at the waistcoat; it struggled, and the shirt
5230	slipped out of it and left it limp and empty in his hand. ""Hold
5230	him!"" said Jaffers, loudly. ""Once he gets the things off--""
5230	
5230	""Hold him!"" cried everyone, and there was a rush at the fluttering
5230	white shirt which was now all that was visible of the stranger.
5230	
5230	The shirt-sleeve planted a shrewd blow in Hall's face that stopped
5230	his open-armed advance, and sent him backward into old Toothsome
5230	the sexton, and in another moment the garment was lifted up and
5230	became convulsed and vacantly flapping about the arms, even as a
5230	shirt that is being thrust over a man's head. Jaffers clutched at
5230	it, and only helped to pull it off; he was struck in the mouth out
5230	of the air, and incontinently threw his truncheon and smote Teddy
5230	Henfrey savagely upon the crown of his head.
5230	
5230	""Look out!"" said everybody, fencing at random and hitting at
5230	nothing. ""Hold him! Shut the door! Don't let him loose! I got
5230	something! Here he is!"" A perfect Babel of noises they made.
5230	Everybody, it seemed, was being hit all at once, and Sandy Wadgers,
5230	knowing as ever and his wits sharpened by a frightful blow in the
5230	nose, reopened the door and led the rout. The others, following
5230	incontinently, were jammed for a moment in the corner by the
5230	doorway. The hitting continued. Phipps, the Unitarian, had a front
5230	tooth broken, and Henfrey was injured in the cartilage of his ear.
5230	Jaffers was struck under the jaw, and, turning, caught at something
5230	that intervened between him and Huxter in the melee, and prevented
5230	their coming together. He felt a muscular chest, and in another
5230	moment the whole mass of struggling, excited men shot out into the
5230	crowded hall.
5230	
5230	""I got him!"" shouted Jaffers, choking and reeling through them all,
5230	and wrestling with purple face and swelling veins against his
5230	unseen enemy.
5230	
5230	Men staggered right and left as the extraordinary conflict swayed
5230	swiftly towards the house door, and went spinning down the
5230	half-dozen steps of the inn. Jaffers cried in a strangled
5230	voice--holding tight, nevertheless, and making play with his
5230	knee--spun around, and fell heavily undermost with his head on
5230	the gravel. Only then did his fingers relax.
5230	
5230	There were excited cries of ""Hold him!"" ""Invisible!"" and so forth,
5230	and a young fellow, a stranger in the place whose name did not come
5230	to light, rushed in at once, caught something, missed his hold,
5230	and fell over the constable's prostrate body. Half-way across the
5230	road a woman screamed as something pushed by her; a dog, kicked
5230	apparently, yelped and ran howling into Huxter's yard, and with
5230	that the transit of the Invisible Man was accomplished. For a space
5230	people stood amazed and gesticulating, and then came panic, and
5230	scattered them abroad through the village as a gust scatters dead
5230	leaves.
5230	
5230	But Jaffers lay quite still, face upward and knees bent, at the foot
5230	of the steps of the inn.

5230	
5230	IN TRANSIT
5230	
5230	
5230	The eighth chapter is exceedingly brief, and relates that Gibbons,
5230	the amateur naturalist of the district, while lying out on the
5230	spacious open downs without a soul within a couple of miles of him,
5230	as he thought, and almost dozing, heard close to him the sound as
5230	of a man coughing, sneezing, and then swearing savagely to himself;
5230	and looking, beheld nothing. Yet the voice was indisputable. It
5230	continued to swear with that breadth and variety that distinguishes
5230	the swearing of a cultivated man. It grew to a climax, diminished
5230	again, and died away in the distance, going as it seemed to him in
5230	the direction of Adderdean. It lifted to a spasmodic sneeze and
5230	ended. Gibbons had heard nothing of the morning's occurrences, but
5230	the phenomenon was so striking and disturbing that his philosophical
5230	tranquillity vanished; he got up hastily, and hurried down the
5230	steepness of the hill towards the village, as fast as he could go.
5230	
5230	
5230	
5230	CHAPTER IX
5230	
5230	MR. THOMAS MARVEL
5230	
5230	
5230	You must picture Mr. Thomas Marvel as a person of copious, flexible
5230	visage, a nose of cylindrical protrusion, a liquorish, ample,
5230	fluctuating mouth, and a beard of bristling eccentricity. His figure
5230	inclined to embonpoint; his short limbs accentuated this inclination.
5230	He wore a furry silk hat, and the frequent substitution of twine and
5230	shoe-laces for buttons, apparent at critical points of his costume,
5230	marked a man essentially bachelor.
5230	
5230	Mr. Thomas Marvel was sitting with his feet in a ditch by the
5230	roadside over the down towards Adderdean, about a mile and a half
5230	out of Iping. His feet, save for socks of irregular open-work, were
5230	bare, his big toes were broad, and pricked like the ears of a
5230	watchful dog. In a leisurely manner--he did everything in a
5230	leisurely manner--he was contemplating trying on a pair of boots.
5230	They were the soundest boots he had come across for a long time, but
5230	too large for him; whereas the ones he had were, in dry weather, a
5230	very comfortable fit, but too thin-soled for damp. Mr. Thomas Marvel
5230	hated roomy shoes, but then he hated damp. He had never properly
5230	thought out which he hated most, and it was a pleasant day, and
5230	there was nothing better to do. So he put the four shoes in a
5230	graceful group on the turf and looked at them. And seeing them there
5230	among the grass and springing agrimony, it suddenly occurred to him
5230	that both pairs were exceedingly ugly to see. He was not at all
5230	startled by a voice behind him.
5230	
5230	""They're boots, anyhow,"" said the Voice.
5230	
5230	""They are--charity boots,"" said Mr. Thomas Marvel, with his head
5230	on one side regarding them distastefully; ""and which is the ugliest
5230	pair in the whole blessed universe, I'm darned if I know!""
5230	
5230	""H'm,"" said the Voice.
5230	
5230	""I've worn worse--in fact, I've worn none. But none so owdacious
5230	ugly--if you'll allow the expression. I've been cadging boots--in
5230	particular--for days. Because I was sick of _them_. They're sound
5230	enough, of course. But a gentleman on tramp sees such a thundering
5230	lot of his boots. And if you'll believe me, I've raised nothing in
5230	the whole blessed country, try as I would, but _them_. Look at 'em!
5230	And a good country for boots, too, in a general way. But it's just
5230	my promiscuous luck. I've got my boots in this country ten years or
5230	more. And then they treat you like this.""
5230	
5230	""It's a beast of a country,"" said the Voice. ""And pigs for people.""
5230	
5230	""Ain't it?"" said Mr. Thomas Marvel. ""Lord! But them boots! It beats
5230	it.""
5230	
5230	He turned his head over his shoulder to the right, to look at the
5230	boots of his interlocutor with a view to comparisons, and lo! where
5230	the boots of his interlocutor should have been were neither legs
5230	nor boots. He was irradiated by the dawn of a great amazement.
5230	""Where _are_ yer?"" said Mr. Thomas Marvel over his shoulder and
5230	coming on all fours. He saw a stretch of empty downs with the wind
5230	swaying the remote green-pointed furze bushes.
5230	
5230	""Am I drunk?"" said Mr. Marvel. ""Have I had visions? Was I talking
5230	to myself? What the--""
5230	
5230	""Don't be alarmed,"" said a Voice.
5230	
5230	""None of your ventriloquising _me_,"" said Mr. Thomas Marvel, rising
5230	sharply to his feet. ""Where _are_ yer? Alarmed, indeed!""
5230	
5230	""Don't be alarmed,"" repeated the Voice.
5230	
5230	""_You'll_ be alarmed in a minute, you silly fool,"" said Mr. Thomas
5230	Marvel. ""Where _are_ yer? Lemme get my mark on yer...
5230	
5230	""Are yer _buried_?"" said Mr. Thomas Marvel, after an interval.
5230	
5230	There was no answer. Mr. Thomas Marvel stood bootless and amazed,
5230	his jacket nearly thrown off.
5230	
5230	""Peewit,"" said a peewit, very remote.
5230	
5230	""Peewit, indeed!"" said Mr. Thomas Marvel. ""This ain't no time for
5230	foolery."" The down was desolate, east and west, north and south;
5230	the road with its shallow ditches and white bordering stakes, ran
5230	smooth and empty north and south, and, save for that peewit, the
5230	blue sky was empty too. ""So help me,"" said Mr. Thomas Marvel,
5230	shuffling his coat on to his shoulders again. ""It's the drink!
5230	I might ha' known.""
5230	
5230	""It's not the drink,"" said the Voice. ""You keep your nerves
5230	steady.""
5230	
5230	""Ow!"" said Mr. Marvel, and his face grew white amidst its patches.
5230	""It's the drink!"" his lips repeated noiselessly. He remained staring
5230	about him, rotating slowly backwards. ""I could have _swore_ I heard
5230	a voice,"" he whispered.
5230	
5230	""Of course you did.""
5230	
5230	""It's there again,"" said Mr. Marvel, closing his eyes and clasping
5230	his hand on his brow with a tragic gesture. He was suddenly taken
5230	by the collar and shaken violently, and left more dazed than ever.
5230	""Don't be a fool,"" said the Voice.
5230	
5230	""I'm--off--my--blooming--chump,"" said Mr. Marvel. ""It's no good.
5230	It's fretting about them blarsted boots. I'm off my blessed blooming
5230	chump. Or it's spirits.""
5230	
5230	""Neither one thing nor the other,"" said the Voice. ""Listen!""
5230	
5230	""Chump,"" said Mr. Marvel.
5230	
5230	""One minute,"" said the Voice, penetratingly, tremulous with
5230	self-control.
5230	
5230	""Well?"" said Mr. Thomas Marvel, with a strange feeling of having
5230	been dug in the chest by a finger.
5230	
5230	""You think I'm just imagination? Just imagination?""
5230	
5230	""What else _can_ you be?"" said Mr. Thomas Marvel, rubbing the back of
5230	his neck.
5230	
5230	""Very well,"" said the Voice, in a tone of relief. ""Then I'm going
5230	to throw flints at you till you think differently.""
5230	
5230	""But where _are_ yer?""
5230	
5230	The Voice made no answer. Whizz came a flint, apparently out of
5230	the air, and missed Mr. Marvel's shoulder by a hair's-breadth.
5230	Mr. Marvel, turning, saw a flint jerk up into the air, trace a
5230	complicated path, hang for a moment, and then fling at his feet
5230	with almost invisible rapidity. He was too amazed to dodge. Whizz
5230	it came, and ricochetted from a bare toe into the ditch. Mr. Thomas
5230	Marvel jumped a foot and howled aloud. Then he started to run,
5230	tripped over an unseen obstacle, and came head over heels into a
5230	sitting position.
5230	
5230	""_Now_,"" said the Voice, as a third stone curved upward and hung in
5230	the air above the tramp. ""Am I imagination?""
5230	
5230	Mr. Marvel by way of reply struggled to his feet, and was
5230	immediately rolled over again. He lay quiet for a moment. ""If you
5230	struggle any more,"" said the Voice, ""I shall throw the flint at
5230	your head.""
5230	
5230	""It's a fair do,"" said Mr. Thomas Marvel, sitting up, taking his
5230	wounded toe in hand and fixing his eye on the third missile. ""I
5230	don't understand it. Stones flinging themselves. Stones talking.
5230	Put yourself down. Rot away. I'm done.""
5230	
5230	The third flint fell.
5230	
5230	""It's very simple,"" said the Voice. ""I'm an invisible man.""
5230	
5230	""Tell us something I don't know,"" said Mr. Marvel, gasping with
5230	pain. ""Where you've hid--how you do it--I _don't_ know. I'm beat.""
5230	
5230	""That's all,"" said the Voice. ""I'm invisible. That's what I want
5230	you to understand.""
5230	
5230	""Anyone could see that. There is no need for you to be so confounded
5230	impatient, mister. _Now_ then. Give us a notion. How are you hid?""
5230	
5230	""I'm invisible. That's the great point. And what I want you to
5230	understand is this--""
5230	
5230	""But whereabouts?"" interrupted Mr. Marvel.
5230	
5230	""Here! Six yards in front of you.""
5230	
5230	""Oh, _come_! I ain't blind. You'll be telling me next you're just
5230	thin air. I'm not one of your ignorant tramps--""
5230	
5230	""Yes, I am--thin air. You're looking through me.""
5230	
5230	""What! Ain't there any stuff to you. _Vox et_--what is it?--jabber.
5230	Is it that?""
5230	
5230	""I am just a human being--solid, needing food and drink, needing
5230	covering too--But I'm invisible. You see? Invisible. Simple idea.
5230	Invisible.""
5230	
5230	""What, real like?""
5230	
5230	""Yes, real.""
5230	
5230	""Let's have a hand of you,"" said Marvel, ""if you _are_ real. It won't
5230	be so darn out-of-the-way like, then--_Lord_!"" he said, ""how you made
5230	me jump!--gripping me like that!""
5230	
5230	He felt the hand that had closed round his wrist with his disengaged
5230	fingers, and his fingers went timorously up the arm, patted a
5230	muscular chest, and explored a bearded face. Marvel's face was
5230	astonishment.
5230	
5230	""I'm dashed!"" he said. ""If this don't beat cock-fighting! Most
5230	remarkable!--And there I can see a rabbit clean through you, 'arf
5230	a mile away! Not a bit of you visible--except--""
5230	
5230	He scrutinised the apparently empty space keenly. ""You 'aven't been
5230	eatin' bread and cheese?"" he asked, holding the invisible arm.
5230	
5230	""You're quite right, and it's not quite assimilated into the system.""
5230	
5230	""Ah!"" said Mr. Marvel. ""Sort of ghostly, though.""
5230	
5230	""Of course, all this isn't half so wonderful as you think.""
5230	
5230	""It's quite wonderful enough for _my_ modest wants,"" said Mr. Thomas
5230	Marvel. ""Howjer manage it! How the dooce is it done?""
5230	
5230	""It's too long a story. And besides--""
5230	
5230	""I tell you, the whole business fairly beats me,"" said Mr. Marvel.
5230	
5230	""What I want to say at present is this: I need help. I have come to
5230	that--I came upon you suddenly. I was wandering, mad with rage,
5230	naked, impotent. I could have murdered. And I saw you--""
5230	
5230	""_Lord_!"" said Mr. Marvel.
5230	
5230	""I came up behind you--hesitated--went on--""
5230	
5230	Mr. Marvel's expression was eloquent.
5230	
5230	""--then stopped. 'Here,' I said, 'is an outcast like myself. This is
5230	the man for me.' So I turned back and came to you--you. And--""
5230	
5230	""_Lord_!"" said Mr. Marvel. ""But I'm all in a tizzy. May I ask--How
5230	is it? And what you may be requiring in the way of help?--Invisible!""
5230	
5230	""I want you to help me get clothes--and shelter--and then, with
5230	other things. I've left them long enough. If you won't--well! But
5230	you _will--must_.""
5230	
5230	""Look here,"" said Mr. Marvel. ""I'm too flabbergasted. Don't knock
5230	me about any more. And leave me go. I must get steady a bit. And
5230	you've pretty near broken my toe. It's all so unreasonable. Empty
5230	downs, empty sky. Nothing visible for miles except the bosom of
5230	Nature. And then comes a voice. A voice out of heaven! And stones!
5230	And a fist--Lord!""
5230	
5230	""Pull yourself together,"" said the Voice, ""for you have to do the
5230	job I've chosen for you.""
5230	
5230	Mr. Marvel blew out his cheeks, and his eyes were round.
5230	
5230	""I've chosen you,"" said the Voice. ""You are the only man except
5230	some of those fools down there, who knows there is such a thing as
5230	an invisible man. You have to be my helper. Help me--and I will
5230	do great things for you. An invisible man is a man of power."" He
5230	stopped for a moment to sneeze violently.
5230	
5230	""But if you betray me,"" he said, ""if you fail to do as I direct you--""
5230	He paused and tapped Mr. Marvel's shoulder smartly. Mr. Marvel
5230	gave a yelp of terror at the touch. ""I don't want to betray you,""
5230	said Mr. Marvel, edging away from the direction of the fingers.
5230	""Don't you go a-thinking that, whatever you do. All I want to do is
5230	to help you--just tell me what I got to do. (Lord!) Whatever you
5230	want done, that I'm most willing to do.""

5230	
5230	CHAPTER X
5230	
5230	MR. MARVEL'S VISIT TO IPING
5230	
5230	
5230	After the first gusty panic had spent itself Iping became
5230	argumentative. Scepticism suddenly reared its head--rather nervous
5230	scepticism, not at all assured of its back, but scepticism
5230	nevertheless. It is so much easier not to believe in an invisible
5230	man; and those who had actually seen him dissolve into air, or felt
5230	the strength of his arm, could be counted on the fingers of two
5230	hands. And of these witnesses Mr. Wadgers was presently missing,
5230	having retired impregnably behind the bolts and bars of his own
5230	house, and Jaffers was lying stunned in the parlour of the ""Coach
5230	and Horses."" Great and strange ideas transcending experience often
5230	have less effect upon men and women than smaller, more tangible
5230	considerations. Iping was gay with bunting, and everybody was in
5230	gala dress. Whit Monday had been looked forward to for a month or
5230	more. By the afternoon even those who believed in the Unseen were
5230	beginning to resume their little amusements in a tentative fashion,
5230	on the supposition that he had quite gone away, and with the
5230	sceptics he was already a jest. But people, sceptics and believers
5230	alike, were remarkably sociable all that day.
5230	
5230	Haysman's meadow was gay with a tent, in which Mrs. Bunting and
5230	other ladies were preparing tea, while, without, the Sunday-school
5230	children ran races and played games under the noisy guidance of the
5230	curate and the Misses Cuss and Sackbut. No doubt there was a slight
5230	uneasiness in the air, but people for the most part had the sense
5230	to conceal whatever imaginative qualms they experienced. On the
5230	village green an inclined strong [rope?], down which, clinging
5230	the while to a pulley-swung handle, one could be hurled violently against
5230	a sack at the other end, came in for considerable favour among the
5230	adolescents, as also did the swings and the cocoanut shies. There
5230	was also promenading, and the steam organ attached to a small
5230	roundabout filled the air with a pungent flavour of oil and with
5230	equally pungent music. Members of the club, who had attended
5230	church in the morning, were splendid in badges of pink and green,
5230	and some of the gayer-minded had also adorned their bowler hats
5230	with brilliant-coloured favours of ribbon. Old Fletcher, whose
5230	conceptions of holiday-making were severe, was visible through the
5230	jasmine about his window or through the open door (whichever way
5230	you chose to look), poised delicately on a plank supported on two
5230	chairs, and whitewashing the ceiling of his front room.
5230	
5230	About four o'clock a stranger entered the village from the direction
5230	of the downs. He was a short, stout person in an extraordinarily
5230	shabby top hat, and he appeared to be very much out of breath. His
5230	cheeks were alternately limp and tightly puffed. His mottled face
5230	was apprehensive, and he moved with a sort of reluctant alacrity. He
5230	turned the corner of the church, and directed his way to the ""Coach
5230	and Horses."" Among others old Fletcher remembers seeing him, and
5230	indeed the old gentleman was so struck by his peculiar agitation
5230	that he inadvertently allowed a quantity of whitewash to run down
5230	the brush into the sleeve of his coat while regarding him.
5230	
5230	This stranger, to the perceptions of the proprietor of the cocoanut
5230	shy, appeared to be talking to himself, and Mr. Huxter remarked the
5230	same thing. He stopped at the foot of the ""Coach and Horses"" steps,
5230	and, according to Mr. Huxter, appeared to undergo a severe internal
5230	struggle before he could induce himself to enter the house. Finally
5230	he marched up the steps, and was seen by Mr. Huxter to turn to the
5230	left and open the door of the parlour. Mr. Huxter heard voices from
5230	within the room and from the bar apprising the man of his error.
5230	""That room's private!"" said Hall, and the stranger shut the door
5230	clumsily and went into the bar.
5230	
5230	In the course of a few minutes he reappeared, wiping his lips with
5230	the back of his hand with an air of quiet satisfaction that somehow
5230	impressed Mr. Huxter as assumed. He stood looking about him for
5230	some moments, and then Mr. Huxter saw him walk in an oddly furtive
5230	manner towards the gates of the yard, upon which the parlour window
5230	opened. The stranger, after some hesitation, leant against one of
5230	the gate-posts, produced a short clay pipe, and prepared to fill
5230	it. His fingers trembled while doing so. He lit it clumsily, and
5230	folding his arms began to smoke in a languid attitude, an attitude
5230	which his occasional glances up the yard altogether belied.
5230	
5230	All this Mr. Huxter saw over the canisters of the tobacco window,
5230	and the singularity of the man's behaviour prompted him to maintain
5230	his observation.
5230	
5230	Presently the stranger stood up abruptly and put his pipe in his
5230	pocket. Then he vanished into the yard. Forthwith Mr. Huxter,
5230	conceiving he was witness of some petty larceny, leapt round his
5230	counter and ran out into the road to intercept the thief. As he did
5230	so, Mr. Marvel reappeared, his hat askew, a big bundle in a blue
5230	table-cloth in one hand, and three books tied together--as it proved
5230	afterwards with the Vicar's braces--in the other. Directly he saw
5230	Huxter he gave a sort of gasp, and turning sharply to the left,
5230	began to run. ""Stop, thief!"" cried Huxter, and set off after him.
5230	Mr. Huxter's sensations were vivid but brief. He saw the man just
5230	before him and spurting briskly for the church corner and the hill
5230	road. He saw the village flags and festivities beyond, and a face or
5230	so turned towards him. He bawled, ""Stop!"" again. He had hardly gone
5230	ten strides before his shin was caught in some mysterious fashion,
5230	and he was no longer running, but flying with inconceivable rapidity
5230	through the air. He saw the ground suddenly close to his face. The
5230	world seemed to splash into a million whirling specks of light, and
5230	subsequent proceedings interested him no more.

5230	CHAPTER XI
5230	
5230	IN THE ""COACH AND HORSES""
5230	
5230	
5230	Now in order clearly to understand what had happened in the inn, it
5230	is necessary to go back to the moment when Mr. Marvel first came
5230	into view of Mr. Huxter's window.
5230	
5230	At that precise moment Mr. Cuss and Mr. Bunting were in the parlour.
5230	They were seriously investigating the strange occurrences of the
5230	morning, and were, with Mr. Hall's permission, making a thorough
5230	examination of the Invisible Man's belongings. Jaffers had partially
5230	recovered from his fall and had gone home in the charge of his
5230	sympathetic friends. The stranger's scattered garments had been
5230	removed by Mrs. Hall and the room tidied up. And on the table under
5230	the window where the stranger had been wont to work, Cuss had hit
5230	almost at once on three big books in manuscript labelled ""Diary.""
5230	
5230	""Diary!"" said Cuss, putting the three books on the table. ""Now, at
5230	any rate, we shall learn something."" The Vicar stood with his hands
5230	on the table.
5230	
5230	""Diary,"" repeated Cuss, sitting down, putting two volumes to
5230	support the third, and opening it. ""H'm--no name on the fly-leaf.
5230	Bother!--cypher. And figures.""
5230	
5230	The vicar came round to look over his shoulder.
5230	
5230	Cuss turned the pages over with a face suddenly disappointed.
5230	""I'm--dear me! It's all cypher, Bunting.""
5230	
5230	""There are no diagrams?"" asked Mr. Bunting. ""No illustrations
5230	throwing light--""
5230	
5230	""See for yourself,"" said Mr. Cuss. ""Some of it's mathematical and
5230	some of it's Russian or some such language (to judge by the
5230	letters), and some of it's Greek. Now the Greek I thought _you_--""
5230	
5230	""Of course,"" said Mr. Bunting, taking out and wiping his spectacles
5230	and feeling suddenly very uncomfortable--for he had no Greek
5230	left in his mind worth talking about; ""yes--the Greek, of course,
5230	may furnish a clue.""
5230	
5230	""I'll find you a place.""
5230	
5230	""I'd rather glance through the volumes first,"" said Mr. Bunting,
5230	still wiping. ""A general impression first, Cuss, and _then_, you
5230	know, we can go looking for clues.""
5230	
5230	He coughed, put on his glasses, arranged them fastidiously, coughed
5230	again, and wished something would happen to avert the seemingly
5230	inevitable exposure. Then he took the volume Cuss handed him in a
5230	leisurely manner. And then something did happen.
5230	
5230	The door opened suddenly.
5230	
5230	Both gentlemen started violently, looked round, and were relieved
5230	to see a sporadically rosy face beneath a furry silk hat. ""Tap?""
5230	asked the face, and stood staring.
5230	
5230	""No,"" said both gentlemen at once.
5230	
5230	""Over the other side, my man,"" said Mr. Bunting. And ""Please shut
5230	that door,"" said Mr. Cuss, irritably.
5230	
5230	""All right,"" said the intruder, as it seemed in a low voice
5230	curiously different from the huskiness of its first inquiry. ""Right
5230	you are,"" said the intruder in the former voice. ""Stand clear!"" and
5230	he vanished and closed the door.
5230	
5230	""A sailor, I should judge,"" said Mr. Bunting. ""Amusing fellows, they
5230	are. Stand clear! indeed. A nautical term, referring to his getting
5230	back out of the room, I suppose.""
5230	
5230	""I daresay so,"" said Cuss. ""My nerves are all loose to-day. It quite
5230	made me jump--the door opening like that.""
5230	
5230	Mr. Bunting smiled as if he had not jumped. ""And now,"" he said with
5230	a sigh, ""these books.""
5230	
5230	Someone sniffed as he did so.
5230	
5230	""One thing is indisputable,"" said Bunting, drawing up a chair next
5230	to that of Cuss. ""There certainly have been very strange things
5230	happen in Iping during the last few days--very strange. I cannot
5230	of course believe in this absurd invisibility story--""
5230	
5230	""It's incredible,"" said Cuss--""incredible. But the fact remains
5230	that I saw--I certainly saw right down his sleeve--""
5230	
5230	""But did you--are you sure? Suppose a mirror, for instance--
5230	hallucinations are so easily produced. I don't know if you
5230	have ever seen a really good conjuror--""
5230	
5230	""I won't argue again,"" said Cuss. ""We've thrashed that out,
5230	Bunting. And just now there's these books--Ah! here's some of
5230	what I take to be Greek! Greek letters certainly.""
5230	
5230	He pointed to the middle of the page. Mr. Bunting flushed slightly
5230	and brought his face nearer, apparently finding some difficulty
5230	with his glasses. Suddenly he became aware of a strange feeling at
5230	the nape of his neck. He tried to raise his head, and encountered
5230	an immovable resistance. The feeling was a curious pressure, the
5230	grip of a heavy, firm hand, and it bore his chin irresistibly to
5230	the table. ""Don't move, little men,"" whispered a voice, ""or I'll
5230	brain you both!"" He looked into the face of Cuss, close to his own,
5230	and each saw a horrified reflection of his own sickly astonishment.
5230	
5230	""I'm sorry to handle you so roughly,"" said the Voice, ""but it's
5230	unavoidable.""
5230	
5230	""Since when did you learn to pry into an investigator's private
5230	memoranda,"" said the Voice; and two chins struck the table
5230	simultaneously, and two sets of teeth rattled.
5230	
5230	""Since when did you learn to invade the private rooms of a man in
5230	misfortune?"" and the concussion was repeated.
5230	
5230	""Where have they put my clothes?""
5230	
5230	""Listen,"" said the Voice. ""The windows are fastened and I've taken
5230	the key out of the door. I am a fairly strong man, and I have the
5230	poker handy--besides being invisible. There's not the slightest
5230	doubt that I could kill you both and get away quite easily if I
5230	wanted to--do you understand? Very well. If I let you go will you
5230	promise not to try any nonsense and do what I tell you?""
5230	
5230	The vicar and the doctor looked at one another, and the doctor
5230	pulled a face. ""Yes,"" said Mr. Bunting, and the doctor repeated it.
5230	Then the pressure on the necks relaxed, and the doctor and the
5230	vicar sat up, both very red in the face and wriggling their heads.
5230	
5230	""Please keep sitting where you are,"" said the Invisible Man.
5230	""Here's the poker, you see.""
5230	
5230	""When I came into this room,"" continued the Invisible Man, after
5230	presenting the poker to the tip of the nose of each of his visitors,
5230	""I did not expect to find it occupied, and I expected to find, in
5230	addition to my books of memoranda, an outfit of clothing. Where is
5230	it? No--don't rise. I can see it's gone. Now, just at present,
5230	though the days are quite warm enough for an invisible man to run
5230	about stark, the evenings are quite chilly. I want clothing--and
5230	other accommodation; and I must also have those three books.""
5230	
5230	
5230	
5230	CHAPTER XII
5230	
5230	THE INVISIBLE MAN LOSES HIS TEMPER
5230	
5230	
5230	It is unavoidable that at this point the narrative should break off
5230	again, for a certain very painful reason that will presently be
5230	apparent. While these things were going on in the parlour, and
5230	while Mr. Huxter was watching Mr. Marvel smoking his pipe against
5230	the gate, not a dozen yards away were Mr. Hall and Teddy Henfrey
5230	discussing in a state of cloudy puzzlement the one Iping topic.
5230	
5230	Suddenly there came a violent thud against the door of the parlour,
5230	a sharp cry, and then--silence.
5230	
5230	""Hul-lo!"" said Teddy Henfrey.
5230	
5230	""Hul-lo!"" from the Tap.
5230	
5230	Mr. Hall took things in slowly but surely. ""That ain't right,"" he
5230	said, and came round from behind the bar towards the parlour door.
5230	
5230	He and Teddy approached the door together, with intent faces. Their
5230	eyes considered. ""Summat wrong,"" said Hall, and Henfrey nodded
5230	agreement. Whiffs of an unpleasant chemical odour met them, and
5230	there was a muffled sound of conversation, very rapid and subdued.
5230	
5230	""You all right thur?"" asked Hall, rapping.
5230	
5230	The muttered conversation ceased abruptly, for a moment silence,
5230	then the conversation was resumed, in hissing whispers, then a
5230	sharp cry of ""No! no, you don't!"" There came a sudden motion and
5230	the oversetting of a chair, a brief struggle. Silence again.
5230	
5230	""What the dooce?"" exclaimed Henfrey, _sotto voce_.
5230	
5230	""You--all--right thur?"" asked Mr. Hall, sharply, again.
5230	
5230	The Vicar's voice answered with a curious jerking intonation:
5230	""Quite ri-right. Please don't--interrupt.""
5230	
5230	""Odd!"" said Mr. Henfrey.
5230	
5230	""Odd!"" said Mr. Hall.
5230	
5230	""Says, 'Don't interrupt,'"" said Henfrey.
5230	
5230	""I heerd'n,"" said Hall.
5230	
5230	""And a sniff,"" said Henfrey.
5230	
5230	They remained listening. The conversation was rapid and subdued.
5230	""I _can't_,"" said Mr. Bunting, his voice rising; ""I tell you, sir,
5230	I _will_ not.""
5230	
5230	""What was that?"" asked Henfrey.
5230	
5230	""Says he wi' nart,"" said Hall. ""Warn't speaking to us, wuz he?""
5230	
5230	""Disgraceful!"" said Mr. Bunting, within.
5230	
5230	""'Disgraceful,'"" said Mr. Henfrey. ""I heard it--distinct.""
5230	
5230	""Who's that speaking now?"" asked Henfrey.
5230	
5230	""Mr. Cuss, I s'pose,"" said Hall. ""Can you hear--anything?""
5230	
5230	Silence. The sounds within indistinct and perplexing.
5230	
5230	""Sounds like throwing the table-cloth about,"" said Hall.
5230	
5230	Mrs. Hall appeared behind the bar. Hall made gestures of silence and
5230	invitation. This aroused Mrs. Hall's wifely opposition. ""What yer
5230	listenin' there for, Hall?"" she asked. ""Ain't you nothin' better to
5230	do--busy day like this?""
5230	
5230	Hall tried to convey everything by grimaces and dumb show, but Mrs.
5230	Hall was obdurate. She raised her voice. So Hall and Henfrey, rather
5230	crestfallen, tiptoed back to the bar, gesticulating to explain to
5230	her.
5230	
5230	At first she refused to see anything in what they had heard at
5230	all. Then she insisted on Hall keeping silence, while Henfrey told
5230	her his story. She was inclined to think the whole business
5230	nonsense--perhaps they were just moving the furniture about. ""I
5230	heerd'n say 'disgraceful'; _that_ I did,"" said Hall.
5230	
5230	""_I_ heerd that, Mrs. Hall,"" said Henfrey.
5230	
5230	""Like as not--"" began Mrs. Hall.
5230	
5230	""Hsh!"" said Mr. Teddy Henfrey. ""Didn't I hear the window?""
5230	
5230	""What window?"" asked Mrs. Hall.
5230	
5230	""Parlour window,"" said Henfrey.
5230	
5230	Everyone stood listening intently. Mrs. Hall's eyes, directed
5230	straight before her, saw without seeing the brilliant oblong of the
5230	inn door, the road white and vivid, and Huxter's shop-front
5230	blistering in the June sun. Abruptly Huxter's door opened and Huxter
5230	appeared, eyes staring with excitement, arms gesticulating. ""Yap!""
5230	cried Huxter. ""Stop thief!"" and he ran obliquely across the oblong
5230	towards the yard gates, and vanished.
5230	
5230	Simultaneously came a tumult from the parlour, and a sound of
5230	windows being closed.
5230	
5230	Hall, Henfrey, and the human contents of the tap rushed out at once
5230	pell-mell into the street. They saw someone whisk round the corner
5230	towards the road, and Mr. Huxter executing a complicated leap in
5230	the air that ended on his face and shoulder. Down the street people
5230	were standing astonished or running towards them.
5230	
5230	Mr. Huxter was stunned. Henfrey stopped to discover this, but Hall
5230	and the two labourers from the Tap rushed at once to the corner,
5230	shouting incoherent things, and saw Mr. Marvel vanishing by the
5230	corner of the church wall. They appear to have jumped to the
5230	impossible conclusion that this was the Invisible Man suddenly
5230	become visible, and set off at once along the lane in pursuit. But
5230	Hall had hardly run a dozen yards before he gave a loud shout of
5230	astonishment and went flying headlong sideways, clutching one of
5230	the labourers and bringing him to the ground. He had been charged
5230	just as one charges a man at football. The second labourer came
5230	round in a circle, stared, and conceiving that Hall had tumbled
5230	over of his own accord, turned to resume the pursuit, only to be
5230	tripped by the ankle just as Huxter had been. Then, as the first
5230	labourer struggled to his feet, he was kicked sideways by a blow
5230	that might have felled an ox.
5230	
5230	As he went down, the rush from the direction of the village green
5230	came round the corner. The first to appear was the proprietor of
5230	the cocoanut shy, a burly man in a blue jersey. He was astonished
5230	to see the lane empty save for three men sprawling absurdly on the
5230	ground. And then something happened to his rear-most foot, and he
5230	went headlong and rolled sideways just in time to graze the feet
5230	of his brother and partner, following headlong. The two were then
5230	kicked, knelt on, fallen over, and cursed by quite a number of
5230	over-hasty people.
5230	
5230	Now when Hall and Henfrey and the labourers ran out of the house,
5230	Mrs. Hall, who had been disciplined by years of experience,
5230	remained in the bar next the till. And suddenly the parlour door
5230	was opened, and Mr. Cuss appeared, and without glancing at her
5230	rushed at once down the steps toward the corner. ""Hold him!"" he
5230	cried. ""Don't let him drop that parcel.""
5230	
5230	He knew nothing of the
5230	existence of Marvel. For the Invisible Man had handed over the
5230	books and bundle in the yard. The face of Mr. Cuss was angry and
5230	resolute, but his costume was defective, a sort of limp white kilt
5230	that could only have passed muster in Greece. ""Hold him!"" he
5230	bawled. ""He's got my trousers! And every stitch of the Vicar's
5230	clothes!""
5230	
5230	""'Tend to him in a minute!"" he cried to Henfrey as he passed the
5230	prostrate Huxter, and, coming round the corner to join the tumult,
5230	was promptly knocked off his feet into an indecorous sprawl.
5230	Somebody in full flight trod heavily on his finger. He yelled,
5230	struggled to regain his feet, was knocked against and thrown on all
5230	fours again, and became aware that he was involved not in a capture,
5230	but a rout. Everyone was running back to the village. He rose again
5230	and was hit severely behind the ear. He staggered and set off back
5230	to the ""Coach and Horses"" forthwith, leaping over the deserted
5230	Huxter, who was now sitting up, on his way.
5230	
5230	Behind him as he was halfway up the inn steps he heard a sudden
5230	yell of rage, rising sharply out of the confusion of cries, and a
5230	sounding smack in someone's face. He recognised the voice as that
5230	of the Invisible Man, and the note was that of a man suddenly
5230	infuriated by a painful blow.
5230	
5230	In another moment Mr. Cuss was back in the parlour. ""He's coming
5230	back, Bunting!"" he said, rushing in. ""Save yourself!""
5230	
5230	Mr. Bunting was standing in the window engaged in an attempt to
5230	clothe himself in the hearth-rug and a _West Surrey Gazette_. ""Who's
5230	coming?"" he said, so startled that his costume narrowly escaped
5230	disintegration.
5230	
5230	""Invisible Man,"" said Cuss, and rushed on to the window. ""We'd
5230	better clear out from here! He's fighting mad! Mad!""
5230	
5230	In another moment he was out in the yard.
5230	
5230	""Good heavens!"" said Mr. Bunting, hesitating between two horrible
5230	alternatives. He heard a frightful struggle in the passage of the
5230	inn, and his decision was made. He clambered out of the window,
5230	adjusted his costume hastily, and fled up the village as fast as
5230	his fat little legs would carry him.
5230	
5230	From the moment when the Invisible Man screamed with rage and Mr.
5230	Bunting made his memorable flight up the village, it became
5230	impossible to give a consecutive account of affairs in Iping.
5230	Possibly the Invisible Man's original intention was simply to cover
5230	Marvel's retreat with the clothes and books. But his temper, at no
5230	time very good, seems to have gone completely at some chance blow,
5230	and forthwith he set to smiting and overthrowing, for the mere
5230	satisfaction of hurting.
5230	
5230	You must figure the street full of running figures, of doors
5230	slamming and fights for hiding-places. You must figure the tumult
5230	suddenly striking on the unstable equilibrium of old Fletcher's
5230	planks and two chairs--with cataclysmic results. You must figure
5230	an appalled couple caught dismally in a swing. And then the whole
5230	tumultuous rush has passed and the Iping street with its gauds and
5230	flags is deserted save for the still raging unseen, and littered
5230	with cocoanuts, overthrown canvas screens, and the scattered stock
5230	in trade of a sweetstuff stall. Everywhere there is a sound of
5230	closing shutters and shoving bolts, and the only visible humanity
5230	is an occasional flitting eye under a raised eyebrow in the corner
5230	of a window pane.
5230	
5230	The Invisible Man amused himself for a little while by breaking all
5230	the windows in the ""Coach and Horses,"" and then he thrust a street
5230	lamp through the parlour window of Mrs. Gribble. He it must have
5230	been who cut the telegraph wire to Adderdean just beyond Higgins'
5230	cottage on the Adderdean road. And after that, as his peculiar
5230	qualities allowed, he passed out of human perceptions altogether,
5230	and he was neither heard, seen, nor felt in Iping any more. He
5230	vanished absolutely.
5230	
5230	But it was the best part of two hours before any human being
5230	ventured out again into the desolation of Iping street.
5230	
5230	
5230	
5230	CHAPTER XIII
5230	
5230	MR. MARVEL DISCUSSES HIS RESIGNATION
5230	
5230	
5230	When the dusk was gathering and Iping was just beginning to peep
5230	timorously forth again upon the shattered wreckage of its Bank
5230	Holiday, a short, thick-set man in a shabby silk hat was marching
5230	painfully through the twilight behind the beechwoods on the road to
5230	Bramblehurst. He carried three books bound together by some sort
5230	of ornamental elastic ligature, and a bundle wrapped in a blue
5230	table-cloth. His rubicund face expressed consternation and fatigue;
5230	he appeared to be in a spasmodic sort of hurry. He was accompanied
5230	by a voice other than his own, and ever and again he winced under
5230	the touch of unseen hands.
5230	
5230	""If you give me the slip again,"" said the Voice, ""if you attempt to
5230	give me the slip again--""
5230	
5230	""Lord!"" said Mr. Marvel. ""That shoulder's a mass of bruises as it
5230	is.""
5230	
5230	""On my honour,"" said the Voice, ""I will kill you.""
5230	
5230	""I didn't try to give you the slip,"" said Marvel, in a voice that
5230	was not far remote from tears. ""I swear I didn't. I didn't know the
5230	blessed turning, that was all! How the devil was I to know the
5230	blessed turning? As it is, I've been knocked about--""
5230	
5230	""You'll get knocked about a great deal more if you don't mind,""
5230	said the Voice, and Mr. Marvel abruptly became silent. He blew out
5230	his cheeks, and his eyes were eloquent of despair.
5230	
5230	""It's bad enough to let these floundering yokels explode my little
5230	secret, without _your_ cutting off with my books. It's lucky for some
5230	of them they cut and ran when they did! Here am I ... No one knew I
5230	was invisible! And now what am I to do?""
5230	
5230	""What am _I_ to do?"" asked Marvel, _sotto voce_.
5230	
5230	""It's all about. It will be in the papers! Everybody will be
5230	looking for me; everyone on their guard--"" The Voice broke off
5230	into vivid curses and ceased.
5230	
5230	The despair of Mr. Marvel's face deepened, and his pace slackened.
5230	
5230	""Go on!"" said the Voice.
5230	
5230	Mr. Marvel's face assumed a greyish tint between the ruddier
5230	patches.
5230	
5230	""Don't drop those books, stupid,"" said the Voice, sharply--overtaking
5230	him.
5230	
5230	""The fact is,"" said the Voice, ""I shall have to make use of you....
5230	You're a poor tool, but I must.""
5230	
5230	""I'm a _miserable_ tool,"" said Marvel.
5230	
5230	""You are,"" said the Voice.
5230	
5230	""I'm the worst possible tool you could have,"" said Marvel.
5230	
5230	""I'm not strong,"" he said after a discouraging silence.
5230	
5230	""I'm not over strong,"" he repeated.
5230	
5230	""No?""
5230	
5230	""And my heart's weak. That little business--I pulled it through,
5230	of course--but bless you! I could have dropped.""
5230	
5230	""Well?""
5230	
5230	""I haven't the nerve and strength for the sort of thing you want.""
5230	
5230	""_I'll_ stimulate you.""
5230	
5230	""I wish you wouldn't. I wouldn't like to mess up your plans, you
5230	know. But I might--out of sheer funk and misery.""
5230	
5230	""You'd better not,"" said the Voice, with quiet emphasis.
5230	
5230	""I wish I was dead,"" said Marvel.
5230	
5230	""It ain't justice,"" he said; ""you must admit.... It seems to me I've
5230	a perfect right--""
5230	
5230	""_Get_ on!"" said the Voice.
5230	
5230	Mr. Marvel mended his pace, and for a time they went in silence
5230	again.
5230	
5230	""It's devilish hard,"" said Mr. Marvel.
5230	
5230	This was quite ineffectual. He tried another tack.
5230	
5230	""What do I make by it?"" he began again in a tone of unendurable
5230	wrong.
5230	
5230	""Oh! _shut up_!"" said the Voice, with sudden amazing vigour. ""I'll
5230	see to you all right. You do what you're told. You'll do it all
5230	right. You're a fool and all that, but you'll do--""
5230	
5230	""I tell you, sir, I'm not the man for it. Respectfully--but
5230	it _is_ so--""
5230	
5230	""If you don't shut up I shall twist your wrist again,"" said the
5230	Invisible Man. ""I want to think.""
5230	
5230	Presently two oblongs of yellow light appeared through the trees,
5230	and the square tower of a church loomed through the gloaming. ""I
5230	shall keep my hand on your shoulder,"" said the Voice, ""all through
5230	the village. Go straight through and try no foolery. It will be the
5230	worse for you if you do.""
5230	
5230	""I know that,"" sighed Mr. Marvel, ""I know all that.""
5230	
5230	The unhappy-looking figure in the obsolete silk hat passed up the
5230	street of the little village with his burdens, and vanished into
5230	the gathering darkness beyond the lights of the windows.
5230	
5230	
5230	
5230	CHAPTER XIV
5230	
5230	AT PORT STOWE
5230	
5230	
5230	Ten o'clock the next morning found Mr. Marvel, unshaven, dirty, and
5230	travel-stained, sitting with the books beside him and his hands deep
5230	in his pockets, looking very weary, nervous, and uncomfortable, and
5230	inflating his cheeks at infrequent intervals, on the bench outside
5230	a little inn on the outskirts of Port Stowe. Beside him were the
5230	books, but now they were tied with string. The bundle had been
5230	abandoned in the pine-woods beyond Bramblehurst, in accordance with
5230	a change in the plans of the Invisible Man. Mr. Marvel sat on the
5230	bench, and although no one took the slightest notice of him, his
5230	agitation remained at fever heat. His hands would go ever and again
5230	to his various pockets with a curious nervous fumbling.
5230	
5230	When he had been sitting for the best part of an hour, however, an
5230	elderly mariner, carrying a newspaper, came out of the inn and sat
5230	down beside him. ""Pleasant day,"" said the mariner.
5230	
5230	Mr. Marvel glanced about him with something very like terror.
5230	""Very,"" he said.
5230	
5230	""Just seasonable weather for the time of year,"" said the mariner,
5230	taking no denial.
5230	
5230	""Quite,"" said Mr. Marvel.
5230	
5230	The mariner produced a toothpick, and (saving his regard) was
5230	engrossed thereby for some minutes. His eyes meanwhile were at
5230	liberty to examine Mr. Marvel's dusty figure, and the books beside
5230	him. As he had approached Mr. Marvel he had heard a sound like the
5230	dropping of coins into a pocket. He was struck by the contrast of
5230	Mr. Marvel's appearance with this suggestion of opulence. Thence
5230	his mind wandered back again to a topic that had taken a curiously
5230	firm hold of his imagination.
5230	
5230	""Books?"" he said suddenly, noisily finishing with the toothpick.
5230	
5230	Mr. Marvel started and looked at them. ""Oh, yes,"" he said. ""Yes,
5230	they're books.""
5230	
5230	""There's some extra-ordinary things in books,"" said the mariner.
5230	
5230	""I believe you,"" said Mr. Marvel.
5230	
5230	""And some extra-ordinary things out of 'em,"" said the mariner.
5230	
5230	""True likewise,"" said Mr. Marvel. He eyed his interlocutor, and
5230	then glanced about him.
5230	
5230	""There's some extra-ordinary things in newspapers, for example,""
5230	said the mariner.
5230	
5230	""There are.""
5230	
5230	""In _this_ newspaper,"" said the mariner.
5230	
5230	""Ah!"" said Mr. Marvel.
5230	
5230	""There's a story,"" said the mariner, fixing Mr. Marvel with an eye
5230	that was firm and deliberate; ""there's a story about an Invisible
5230	Man, for instance.""
5230	
5230	Mr. Marvel pulled his mouth askew and scratched his cheek and felt
5230	his ears glowing. ""What will they be writing next?"" he asked
5230	faintly. ""Ostria, or America?""
5230	
5230	""Neither,"" said the mariner. ""_Here_.""
5230	
5230	""Lord!"" said Mr. Marvel, starting.
5230	
5230	""When I say _here_,"" said the mariner, to Mr. Marvel's intense
5230	relief, ""I don't of course mean here in this place, I mean
5230	hereabouts.""
5230	
5230	""An Invisible Man!"" said Mr. Marvel. ""And what's _he_ been up to?""
5230	
5230	""Everything,"" said the mariner, controlling Marvel with his eye,
5230	and then amplifying, ""every--blessed--thing.""
5230	
5230	""I ain't seen a paper these four days,"" said Marvel.
5230	
5230	""Iping's the place he started at,"" said the mariner.
5230	
5230	""In-_deed_!"" said Mr. Marvel.
5230	
5230	""He started there. And where he came from, nobody don't seem to
5230	know. Here it is: 'Pe-culiar Story from Iping.' And it says in this
5230	paper that the evidence is extra-ordinary strong--extra-ordinary.""
5230	
5230	""Lord!"" said Mr. Marvel.
5230	
5230	""But then, it's an extra-ordinary story. There is a clergyman and a
5230	medical gent witnesses--saw 'im all right and proper--or leastways
5230	didn't see 'im. He was staying, it says, at the 'Coach an' Horses,'
5230	and no one don't seem to have been aware of his misfortune, it says,
5230	aware of his misfortune, until in an Altercation in the inn, it
5230	says, his bandages on his head was torn off. It was then ob-served
5230	that his head was invisible. Attempts were At Once made to secure
5230	him, but casting off his garments, it says, he succeeded in
5230	escaping, but not until after a desperate struggle, in which he
5230	had inflicted serious injuries, it says, on our worthy and able
5230	constable, Mr. J. A. Jaffers. Pretty straight story, eh? Names and
5230	everything.""
5230	
5230	""Lord!"" said Mr. Marvel, looking nervously about him, trying to
5230	count the money in his pockets by his unaided sense of touch, and
5230	full of a strange and novel idea. ""It sounds most astonishing.""
5230	
5230	""Don't it? Extra-ordinary, _I_ call it. Never heard tell of Invisible
5230	Men before, I haven't, but nowadays one hears such a lot of
5230	extra-ordinary things--that--""
5230	
5230	""That all he did?"" asked Marvel, trying to seem at his ease.
5230	
5230	""It's enough, ain't it?"" said the mariner.
5230	
5230	""Didn't go Back by any chance?"" asked Marvel. ""Just escaped and
5230	that's all, eh?""
5230	
5230	""All!"" said the mariner. ""Why!--ain't it enough?""
5230	
5230	""Quite enough,"" said Marvel.
5230	
5230	""I should think it was enough,"" said the mariner. ""I should think
5230	it was enough.""
5230	
5230	""He didn't have any pals--it don't say he had any pals, does it?""
5230	asked Mr. Marvel, anxious.
5230	
5230	""Ain't one of a sort enough for you?"" asked the mariner. ""No, thank
5230	Heaven, as one might say, he didn't.""
5230	
5230	He nodded his head slowly. ""It makes me regular uncomfortable,
5230	the bare thought of that chap running about the country! He is at
5230	present At Large, and from certain evidence it is supposed that he
5230	has--taken--_took_, I suppose they mean--the road to Port Stowe. You
5230	see we're right _in_ it! None of your American wonders, this time.
5230	And just think of the things he might do! Where'd you be, if he took
5230	a drop over and above, and had a fancy to go for you? Suppose he
5230	wants to rob--who can prevent him? He can trespass, he can burgle,
5230	he could walk through a cordon of policemen as easy as me or you
5230	could give the slip to a blind man! Easier! For these here blind
5230	chaps hear uncommon sharp, I'm told. And wherever there was liquor
5230	he fancied--""
5230	
5230	""He's got a tremenjous advantage, certainly,"" said Mr. Marvel.
5230	""And--well...""
5230	
5230	""You're right,"" said the mariner. ""He _has_.""
5230	
5230	All this time Mr. Marvel had been glancing about him intently,
5230	listening for faint footfalls, trying to detect imperceptible
5230	movements. He seemed on the point of some great resolution. He
5230	coughed behind his hand.
5230	
5230	He looked about him again, listened, bent towards the mariner, and
5230	lowered his voice: ""The fact of it is--I happen--to know just a
5230	thing or two about this Invisible Man. From private sources.""
5230	
5230	""Oh!"" said the mariner, interested. ""_You_?""
5230	
5230	""Yes,"" said Mr. Marvel. ""Me.""
5230	
5230	""Indeed!"" said the mariner. ""And may I ask--""
5230	
5230	""You'll be astonished,"" said Mr. Marvel behind his hand. ""It's
5230	tremenjous.""
5230	
5230	""Indeed!"" said the mariner.
5230	
5230	""The fact is,"" began Mr. Marvel eagerly in a confidential undertone.
5230	Suddenly his expression changed marvellously. ""Ow!"" he said. He rose
5230	stiffly in his seat. His face was eloquent of physical suffering.
5230	""Wow!"" he said.
5230	
5230	""What's up?"" said the mariner, concerned.
5230	
5230	""Toothache,"" said Mr. Marvel, and put his hand to his ear. He caught
5230	hold of his books. ""I must be getting on, I think,"" he said. He
5230	edged in a curious way along the seat away from his interlocutor.
5230	""But you was just a-going to tell me about this here Invisible Man!""
5230	protested the mariner. Mr. Marvel seemed to consult with himself.
5230	""Hoax,"" said a Voice. ""It's a hoax,"" said Mr. Marvel.
5230	
5230	""But it's in the paper,"" said the mariner.
5230	
5230	""Hoax all the same,"" said Marvel. ""I know the chap that started the
5230	lie. There ain't no Invisible Man whatsoever--Blimey.""
5230	
5230	""But how 'bout this paper? D'you mean to say--?""
5230	
5230	""Not a word of it,"" said Marvel, stoutly.
5230	
5230	The mariner stared, paper in hand. Mr. Marvel jerkily faced about.
5230	""Wait a bit,"" said the mariner, rising and speaking slowly, ""D'you
5230	mean to say--?""
5230	
5230	""I do,"" said Mr. Marvel.
5230	
5230	""Then why did you let me go on and tell you all this blarsted
5230	stuff, then? What d'yer mean by letting a man make a fool of
5230	himself like that for? Eh?""
5230	
5230	Mr. Marvel blew out his cheeks. The mariner was suddenly very red
5230	indeed; he clenched his hands. ""I been talking here this ten
5230	minutes,"" he said; ""and you, you little pot-bellied, leathery-faced
5230	son of an old boot, couldn't have the elementary manners--""
5230	
5230	""Don't you come bandying words with _me_,"" said Mr. Marvel.
5230	
5230	""Bandying words! I'm a jolly good mind--""
5230	
5230	""Come up,"" said a Voice, and Mr. Marvel was suddenly whirled about
5230	and started marching off in a curious spasmodic manner. ""You'd
5230	better move on,"" said the mariner. ""Who's moving on?"" said Mr.
5230	Marvel. He was receding obliquely with a curious hurrying gait, with
5230	occasional violent jerks forward. Some way along the road he began
5230	a muttered monologue, protests and recriminations.
5230	
5230	""Silly devil!"" said the mariner, legs wide apart, elbows akimbo,
5230	watching the receding figure. ""I'll show you, you silly ass--hoaxing
5230	_me_! It's here--on the paper!""
5230	
5230	Mr. Marvel retorted incoherently and, receding, was hidden by a bend
5230	in the road, but the mariner still stood magnificent in the midst
5230	of the way, until the approach of a butcher's cart dislodged him.
5230	Then he turned himself towards Port Stowe. ""Full of extra-ordinary
5230	asses,"" he said softly to himself. ""Just to take me down a bit--that
5230	was his silly game--It's on the paper!""
5230	
5230	And there was another extraordinary thing he was presently to hear,
5230	that had happened quite close to him. And that was a vision of a
5230	""fist full of money"" (no less) travelling without visible agency,
5230	along by the wall at the corner of St. Michael's Lane. A brother
5230	mariner had seen this wonderful sight that very morning. He had
5230	snatched at the money forthwith and had been knocked headlong, and
5230	when he had got to his feet the butterfly money had vanished. Our
5230	mariner was in the mood to believe anything, he declared, but that
5230	was a bit _too_ stiff. Afterwards, however, he began to think things
5230	over.
5230	
5230	The story of the flying money was true. And all about that
5230	neighbourhood, even from the august London and Country Banking
5230	Company, from the tills of shops and inns--doors standing that sunny
5230	weather entirely open--money had been quietly and dexterously making
5230	off that day in handfuls and rouleaux, floating quietly along by
5230	walls and shady places, dodging quickly from the approaching eyes of
5230	men. And it had, though no man had traced it, invariably ended its
5230	mysterious flight in the pocket of that agitated gentleman in the
5230	obsolete silk hat, sitting outside the little inn on the outskirts
5230	of Port Stowe.
5230	
5230	It was ten days after--and indeed only when the Burdock story was
5230	already old--that the mariner collated these facts and began to
5230	understand how near he had been to the wonderful Invisible Man.
5230	
5230	
5230	
5230	CHAPTER XV
5230	
5230	THE MAN WHO WAS RUNNING
5230	
5230	
5230	In the early evening time Dr. Kemp was sitting in his study in the
5230	belvedere on the hill overlooking Burdock. It was a pleasant little
5230	room, with three windows--north, west, and south--and bookshelves
5230	covered with books and scientific publications, and a broad
5230	writing-table, and, under the north window, a microscope, glass
5230	slips, minute instruments, some cultures, and scattered bottles of
5230	reagents. Dr. Kemp's solar lamp was lit, albeit the sky was still
5230	bright with the sunset light, and his blinds were up because there
5230	was no offence of peering outsiders to require them pulled down.
5230	Dr. Kemp was a tall and slender young man, with flaxen hair and a
5230	moustache almost white, and the work he was upon would earn him, he
5230	hoped, the fellowship of the Royal Society, so highly did he think
5230	of it.
5230	
5230	And his eye, presently wandering from his work, caught the sunset
5230	blazing at the back of the hill that is over against his own. For a
5230	minute perhaps he sat, pen in mouth, admiring the rich golden
5230	colour above the crest, and then his attention was attracted by the
5230	little figure of a man, inky black, running over the hill-brow
5230	towards him. He was a shortish little man, and he wore a high hat,
5230	and he was running so fast that his legs verily twinkled.
5230	
5230	""Another of those fools,"" said Dr. Kemp. ""Like that ass who ran
5230	into me this morning round a corner, with the ''Visible Man
5230	a-coming, sir!' I can't imagine what possesses people. One might
5230	think we were in the thirteenth century.""
5230	
5230	He got up, went to the window, and stared at the dusky hillside, and
5230	the dark little figure tearing down it. ""He seems in a confounded
5230	hurry,"" said Dr. Kemp, ""but he doesn't seem to be getting on. If
5230	his pockets were full of lead, he couldn't run heavier.""
5230	
5230	""Spurted, sir,"" said Dr. Kemp.
5230	
5230	In another moment the higher of the villas that had clambered up the
5230	hill from Burdock had occulted the running figure. He was visible
5230	again for a moment, and again, and then again, three times between
5230	the three detached houses that came next, and then the terrace hid
5230	him.
5230	
5230	""Asses!"" said Dr. Kemp, swinging round on his heel and walking
5230	back to his writing-table.
5230	
5230	But those who saw the fugitive nearer, and perceived the abject
5230	terror on his perspiring face, being themselves in the open roadway,
5230	did not share in the doctor's contempt. By the man pounded, and as
5230	he ran he chinked like a well-filled purse that is tossed to and
5230	fro. He looked neither to the right nor the left, but his dilated
5230	eyes stared straight downhill to where the lamps were being lit, and
5230	the people were crowded in the street. And his ill-shaped mouth fell
5230	apart, and a glairy foam lay on his lips, and his breath came hoarse
5230	and noisy. All he passed stopped and began staring up the road and
5230	down, and interrogating one another with an inkling of discomfort
5230	for the reason of his haste.
5230	
5230	And then presently, far up the hill, a dog playing in the road
5230	yelped and ran under a gate, and as they still wondered
5230	something--a wind--a pad, pad, pad,--a sound like a panting breathing,
5230	rushed by.
5230	
5230	People screamed. People sprang off the pavement: It passed in
5230	shouts, it passed by instinct down the hill. They were shouting in
5230	the street before Marvel was halfway there. They were bolting into
5230	houses and slamming the doors behind them, with the news. He heard
5230	it and made one last desperate spurt. Fear came striding by, rushed
5230	ahead of him, and in a moment had seized the town.
5230	
5230	""The Invisible Man is coming! The Invisible Man!""
5230	
5230	
5230	
5230	CHAPTER XVI
5230	
5230	IN THE ""JOLLY CRICKETERS""
5230	
5230	
5230	The ""Jolly Cricketers"" is just at the bottom of the hill, where the
5230	tram-lines begin. The barman leant his fat red arms on the counter
5230	and talked of horses with an anaemic cabman, while a black-bearded
5230	man in grey snapped up biscuit and cheese, drank Burton, and
5230	conversed in American with a policeman off duty.
5230	
5230	""What's the shouting about!"" said the anaemic cabman, going off at a
5230	tangent, trying to see up the hill over the dirty yellow blind in
5230	the low window of the inn. Somebody ran by outside. ""Fire, perhaps,""
5230	said the barman.
5230	
5230	Footsteps approached, running heavily, the door was pushed open
5230	violently, and Marvel, weeping and dishevelled, his hat gone, the
5230	neck of his coat torn open, rushed in, made a convulsive turn, and
5230	attempted to shut the door. It was held half open by a strap.
5230	
5230	""Coming!"" he bawled, his voice shrieking with terror. ""He's coming.
5230	The 'Visible Man! After me! For Gawd's sake! 'Elp! 'Elp! 'Elp!""
5230	
5230	""Shut the doors,"" said the policeman. ""Who's coming? What's the
5230	row?"" He went to the door, released the strap, and it slammed. The
5230	American closed the other door.
5230	
5230	""Lemme go inside,"" said Marvel, staggering and weeping, but still
5230	clutching the books. ""Lemme go inside. Lock me in--somewhere. I
5230	tell you he's after me. I give him the slip. He said he'd kill me
5230	and he will.""
5230	
5230	""_You're_ safe,"" said the man with the black beard. ""The door's shut.
5230	What's it all about?""
5230	
5230	""Lemme go inside,"" said Marvel, and shrieked aloud as a blow
5230	suddenly made the fastened door shiver and was followed by a hurried
5230	rapping and a shouting outside. ""Hullo,"" cried the policeman, ""who's
5230	there?"" Mr. Marvel began to make frantic dives at panels that looked
5230	like doors. ""He'll kill me--he's got a knife or something. For
5230	Gawd's sake--!""
5230	
5230	""Here you are,"" said the barman. ""Come in here."" And he held up the
5230	flap of the bar.
5230	
5230	Mr. Marvel rushed behind the bar as the summons outside was
5230	repeated. ""Don't open the door,"" he screamed. ""_Please_ don't open
5230	the door. _Where_ shall I hide?""
5230	
5230	""This, this Invisible Man, then?"" asked the man with the black
5230	beard, with one hand behind him. ""I guess it's about time we saw
5230	him.""
5230	
5230	The window of the inn was suddenly smashed in, and there was a
5230	screaming and running to and fro in the street. The policeman had
5230	been standing on the settee staring out, craning to see who was at
5230	the door. He got down with raised eyebrows. ""It's that,"" he said.
5230	The barman stood in front of the bar-parlour door which was now
5230	locked on Mr. Marvel, stared at the smashed window, and came round
5230	to the two other men.
5230	
5230	Everything was suddenly quiet. ""I wish I had my truncheon,"" said
5230	the policeman, going irresolutely to the door. ""Once we open, in he
5230	comes. There's no stopping him.""
5230	
5230	""Don't you be in too much hurry about that door,"" said the anaemic
5230	cabman, anxiously.
5230	
5230	""Draw the bolts,"" said the man with the black beard, ""and if he
5230	comes--"" He showed a revolver in his hand.
5230	
5230	""That won't do,"" said the policeman; ""that's murder.""
5230	
5230	""I know what country I'm in,"" said the man with the beard. ""I'm
5230	going to let off at his legs. Draw the bolts.""
5230	
5230	""Not with that blinking thing going off behind me,"" said the
5230	barman, craning over the blind.
5230	
5230	""Very well,"" said the man with the black beard, and stooping down,
5230	revolver ready, drew them himself. Barman, cabman, and policeman
5230	faced about.
5230	
5230	""Come in,"" said the bearded man in an undertone, standing back and
5230	facing the unbolted doors with his pistol behind him. No one came
5230	in, the door remained closed. Five minutes afterwards when a second
5230	cabman pushed his head in cautiously, they were still waiting, and
5230	an anxious face peered out of the bar-parlour and supplied
5230	information. ""Are all the doors of the house shut?"" asked Marvel.
5230	""He's going round--prowling round. He's as artful as the devil.""
5230	
5230	""Good Lord!"" said the burly barman. ""There's the back! Just watch
5230	them doors! I say--!"" He looked about him helplessly. The
5230	bar-parlour door slammed and they heard the key turn. ""There's
5230	the yard door and the private door. The yard door--""
5230	
5230	He rushed out of the bar.
5230	
5230	In a minute he reappeared with a carving-knife in his hand. ""The
5230	yard door was open!"" he said, and his fat underlip dropped. ""He may
5230	be in the house now!"" said the first cabman.
5230	
5230	""He's not in the kitchen,"" said the barman. ""There's two women
5230	there, and I've stabbed every inch of it with this little beef
5230	slicer. And they don't think he's come in. They haven't noticed--""
5230	
5230	""Have you fastened it?"" asked the first cabman.
5230	
5230	""I'm out of frocks,"" said the barman.
5230	
5230	The man with the beard replaced his revolver. And even as he did so
5230	the flap of the bar was shut down and the bolt clicked, and then
5230	with a tremendous thud the catch of the door snapped and the
5230	bar-parlour door burst open. They heard Marvel squeal like a caught
5230	leveret, and forthwith they were clambering over the bar to his
5230	rescue. The bearded man's revolver cracked and the looking-glass at
5230	the back of the parlour starred and came smashing and tinkling down.
5230	
5230	As the barman entered the room he saw Marvel, curiously crumpled up
5230	and struggling against the door that led to the yard and kitchen.
5230	The door flew open while the barman hesitated, and Marvel was
5230	dragged into the kitchen. There was a scream and a clatter of pans.
5230	Marvel, head down, and lugging back obstinately, was forced to the
5230	kitchen door, and the bolts were drawn.
5230	
5230	Then the policeman, who had been trying to pass the barman, rushed
5230	in, followed by one of the cabmen, gripped the wrist of the
5230	invisible hand that collared Marvel, was hit in the face and went
5230	reeling back. The door opened, and Marvel made a frantic effort to
5230	obtain a lodgment behind it. Then the cabman collared something.
5230	""I got him,"" said the cabman. The barman's red hands came clawing
5230	at the unseen. ""Here he is!"" said the barman.
5230	
5230	Mr. Marvel, released, suddenly dropped to the ground and made an
5230	attempt to crawl behind the legs of the fighting men. The struggle
5230	blundered round the edge of the door. The voice of the Invisible
5230	Man was heard for the first time, yelling out sharply, as the
5230	policeman trod on his foot. Then he cried out passionately and
5230	his fists flew round like flails. The cabman suddenly whooped
5230	and doubled up, kicked under the diaphragm. The door into the
5230	bar-parlour from the kitchen slammed and covered Mr. Marvel's
5230	retreat. The men in the kitchen found themselves clutching at and
5230	struggling with empty air.
5230	
5230	""Where's he gone?"" cried the man with the beard. ""Out?""
5230	
5230	""This way,"" said the policeman, stepping into the yard and
5230	stopping.
5230	
5230	A piece of tile whizzed by his head and smashed among the crockery
5230	on the kitchen table.
5230	
5230	""I'll show him,"" shouted the man with the black beard, and suddenly
5230	a steel barrel shone over the policeman's shoulder, and five
5230	bullets had followed one another into the twilight whence the
5230	missile had come. As he fired, the man with the beard moved his
5230	hand in a horizontal curve, so that his shots radiated out into the
5230	narrow yard like spokes from a wheel.
5230	
5230	A silence followed. ""Five cartridges,"" said the man with the black
5230	beard. ""That's the best of all. Four aces and a joker. Get a
5230	lantern, someone, and come and feel about for his body.""
5230	
5230	
5230	
5230	CHAPTER XVII
5230	
5230	DR. KEMP'S VISITOR
5230	
5230	
5230	Dr. Kemp had continued writing in his study until the shots
5230	aroused him. Crack, crack, crack, they came one after the other.
5230	
5230	""Hullo!"" said Dr. Kemp, putting his pen into his mouth again and
5230	listening. ""Who's letting off revolvers in Burdock? What are the
5230	asses at now?""
5230	
5230	He went to the south window, threw it up, and leaning out stared
5230	down on the network of windows, beaded gas-lamps and shops, with its
5230	black interstices of roof and yard that made up the town at night.
5230	""Looks like a crowd down the hill,"" he said, ""by 'The Cricketers,'""
5230	and remained watching. Thence his eyes wandered over the town to far
5230	away where the ships' lights shone, and the pier glowed--a little
5230	illuminated, facetted pavilion like a gem of yellow light. The moon
5230	in its first quarter hung over the westward hill, and the stars were
5230	clear and almost tropically bright.
5230	
5230	After five minutes, during which his mind had travelled into a
5230	remote speculation of social conditions of the future, and lost
5230	itself at last over the time dimension, Dr. Kemp roused himself
5230	with a sigh, pulled down the window again, and returned to his
5230	writing desk.
5230	
5230	It must have been about an hour after this that the front-door bell
5230	rang. He had been writing slackly, and with intervals of
5230	abstraction, since the shots. He sat listening. He heard the servant
5230	answer the door, and waited for her feet on the staircase, but she
5230	did not come. ""Wonder what that was,"" said Dr. Kemp.
5230	
5230	He tried to resume his work, failed, got up, went downstairs from
5230	his study to the landing, rang, and called over the balustrade to
5230	the housemaid as she appeared in the hall below. ""Was that a
5230	letter?"" he asked.
5230	
5230	""Only a runaway ring, sir,"" she answered.
5230	
5230	""I'm restless to-night,"" he said to himself. He went back to his
5230	study, and this time attacked his work resolutely. In a little
5230	while he was hard at work again, and the only sounds in the room
5230	were the ticking of the clock and the subdued shrillness of his
5230	quill, hurrying in the very centre of the circle of light his
5230	lampshade threw on his table.
5230	
5230	It was two o'clock before Dr. Kemp had finished his work for the
5230	night. He rose, yawned, and went downstairs to bed. He had already
5230	removed his coat and vest, when he noticed that he was thirsty. He
5230	took a candle and went down to the dining-room in search of a
5230	syphon and whiskey.
5230	
5230	Dr. Kemp's scientific pursuits have made him a very observant
5230	man, and as he recrossed the hall, he noticed a dark spot on the
5230	linoleum near the mat at the foot of the stairs. He went on
5230	upstairs, and then it suddenly occurred to him to ask himself what
5230	the spot on the linoleum might be. Apparently some subconscious
5230	element was at work. At any rate, he turned with his burden, went
5230	back to the hall, put down the syphon and whiskey, and bending
5230	down, touched the spot. Without any great surprise he found it had
5230	the stickiness and colour of drying blood.
5230	
5230	He took up his burden again, and returned upstairs, looking about
5230	him and trying to account for the blood-spot. On the landing he saw
5230	something and stopped astonished. The door-handle of his own room
5230	was blood-stained.
5230	
5230	He looked at his own hand. It was quite clean, and then he
5230	remembered that the door of his room had been open when he came down
5230	from his study, and that consequently he had not touched the handle
5230	at all. He went straight into his room, his face quite calm--perhaps
5230	a trifle more resolute than usual. His glance, wandering
5230	inquisitively, fell on the bed. On the counterpane was a mess of
5230	blood, and the sheet had been torn. He had not noticed this before
5230	because he had walked straight to the dressing-table. On the further
5230	side the bedclothes were depressed as if someone had been recently
5230	sitting there.
5230	
5230	Then he had an odd impression that he had heard a low voice say,
5230	""Good Heavens!--Kemp!"" But Dr. Kemp was no believer in voices.
5230	
5230	He stood staring at the tumbled sheets. Was that really a voice? He
5230	looked about again, but noticed nothing further than the disordered
5230	and blood-stained bed. Then he distinctly heard a movement across
5230	the room, near the wash-hand stand. All men, however highly
5230	educated, retain some superstitious inklings. The feeling that is
5230	called ""eerie"" came upon him. He closed the door of the room, came
5230	forward to the dressing-table, and put down his burdens. Suddenly,
5230	with a start, he perceived a coiled and blood-stained bandage of
5230	linen rag hanging in mid-air, between him and the wash-hand stand.
5230	
5230	He stared at this in amazement. It was an empty bandage, a bandage
5230	properly tied but quite empty. He would have advanced to grasp it,
5230	but a touch arrested him, and a voice speaking quite close to him.
5230	
5230	""Kemp!"" said the Voice.
5230	
5230	""Eh?"" said Kemp, with his mouth open.
5230	
5230	""Keep your nerve,"" said the Voice. ""I'm an Invisible Man.""
5230	
5230	Kemp made no answer for a space, simply stared at the bandage.
5230	""Invisible Man,"" he said.
5230	
5230	""I am an Invisible Man,"" repeated the Voice.
5230	
5230	The story he had been active to ridicule only that morning rushed
5230	through Kemp's brain. He does not appear to have been either very
5230	much frightened or very greatly surprised at the moment.
5230	Realisation came later.
5230	
5230	""I thought it was all a lie,"" he said. The thought uppermost in his
5230	mind was the reiterated arguments of the morning. ""Have you a
5230	bandage on?"" he asked.
5230	
5230	""Yes,"" said the Invisible Man.
5230	
5230	""Oh!"" said Kemp, and then roused himself. ""I say!"" he said. ""But
5230	this is nonsense. It's some trick."" He stepped forward suddenly,
5230	and his hand, extended towards the bandage, met invisible fingers.
5230	
5230	He recoiled at the touch and his colour changed.
5230	
5230	""Keep steady, Kemp, for God's sake! I want help badly. Stop!""
5230	
5230	The hand gripped his arm. He struck at it.
5230	
5230	""Kemp!"" cried the Voice. ""Kemp! Keep steady!"" and the grip
5230	tightened.
5230	
5230	A frantic desire to free himself took possession of Kemp. The hand
5230	of the bandaged arm gripped his shoulder, and he was suddenly
5230	tripped and flung backwards upon the bed. He opened his mouth to
5230	shout, and the corner of the sheet was thrust between his teeth.
5230	The Invisible Man had him down grimly, but his arms were free and
5230	he struck and tried to kick savagely.
5230	
5230	""Listen to reason, will you?"" said the Invisible Man, sticking to
5230	him in spite of a pounding in the ribs. ""By Heaven! you'll madden
5230	me in a minute!
5230	
5230	""Lie still, you fool!"" bawled the Invisible Man in Kemp's ear.
5230	
5230	Kemp struggled for another moment and then lay still.
5230	
5230	""If you shout, I'll smash your face,"" said the Invisible Man,
5230	relieving his mouth.
5230	
5230	""I'm an Invisible Man. It's no foolishness, and no magic. I really
5230	am an Invisible Man. And I want your help. I don't want to hurt
5230	you, but if you behave like a frantic rustic, I must. Don't you
5230	remember me, Kemp? Griffin, of University College?""
5230	
5230	""Let me get up,"" said Kemp. ""I'll stop where I am. And let me sit
5230	quiet for a minute.""
5230	
5230	He sat up and felt his neck.
5230	
5230	""I am Griffin, of University College, and I have made myself
5230	invisible. I am just an ordinary man--a man you have known--made
5230	invisible.""
5230	
5230	""Griffin?"" said Kemp.
5230	
5230	""Griffin,"" answered the Voice. A younger student than you were,
5230	almost an albino, six feet high, and broad, with a pink and white
5230	face and red eyes, who won the medal for chemistry.""
5230	
5230	""I am confused,"" said Kemp. ""My brain is rioting. What has this to
5230	do with Griffin?""
5230	
5230	""I _am_ Griffin.""
5230	
5230	Kemp thought. ""It's horrible,"" he said. ""But what devilry must
5230	happen to make a man invisible?""
5230	
5230	""It's no devilry. It's a process, sane and intelligible enough--""
5230	
5230	""It's horrible!"" said Kemp. ""How on earth--?""
5230	
5230	""It's horrible enough. But I'm wounded and in pain, and tired ...
5230	Great God! Kemp, you are a man. Take it steady. Give me some food
5230	and drink, and let me sit down here.""
5230	
5230	Kemp stared at the bandage as it moved across the room, then saw a
5230	basket chair dragged across the floor and come to rest near the bed.
5230	It creaked, and the seat was depressed the quarter of an inch or so.
5230	He rubbed his eyes and felt his neck again. ""This beats ghosts,"" he
5230	said, and laughed stupidly.
5230	
5230	""That's better. Thank Heaven, you're getting sensible!""
5230	
5230	""Or silly,"" said Kemp, and knuckled his eyes.
5230	
5230	""Give me some whiskey. I'm near dead.""
5230	
5230	""It didn't feel so. Where are you? If I get up shall I run into you?
5230	_There_! all right. Whiskey? Here. Where shall I give it to you?""
5230	
5230	The chair creaked and Kemp felt the glass drawn away from him. He
5230	let go by an effort; his instinct was all against it. It came to
5230	rest poised twenty inches above the front edge of the seat of the
5230	chair. He stared at it in infinite perplexity. ""This is--this
5230	must be--hypnotism. You have suggested you are invisible.""
5230	
5230	""Nonsense,"" said the Voice.
5230	
5230	""It's frantic.""
5230	
5230	""Listen to me.""
5230	
5230	""I demonstrated conclusively this morning,"" began Kemp, ""that
5230	invisibility--""
5230	
5230	""Never mind what you've demonstrated!--I'm starving,"" said the
5230	Voice, ""and the night is chilly to a man without clothes.""
5230	
5230	""Food?"" said Kemp.
5230	
5230	The tumbler of whiskey tilted itself. ""Yes,"" said the Invisible Man
5230	rapping it down. ""Have you a dressing-gown?""
5230	
5230	Kemp made some exclamation in an undertone. He walked to a wardrobe
5230	and produced a robe of dingy scarlet. ""This do?"" he asked. It was
5230	taken from him. It hung limp for a moment in mid-air, fluttered
5230	weirdly, stood full and decorous buttoning itself, and sat down in
5230	his chair. ""Drawers, socks, slippers would be a comfort,"" said the
5230	Unseen, curtly. ""And food.""
5230	
5230	""Anything. But this is the insanest thing I ever was in, in my
5230	life!""
5230	
5230	He turned out his drawers for the articles, and then went downstairs
5230	to ransack his larder. He came back with some cold cutlets and
5230	bread, pulled up a light table, and placed them before his guest.
5230	""Never mind knives,"" said his visitor, and a cutlet hung in mid-air,
5230	with a sound of gnawing.
5230	
5230	""Invisible!"" said Kemp, and sat down on a bedroom chair.
5230	
5230	""I always like to get something about me before I eat,"" said the
5230	Invisible Man, with a full mouth, eating greedily. ""Queer fancy!""
5230	
5230	""I suppose that wrist is all right,"" said Kemp.
5230	
5230	""Trust me,"" said the Invisible Man.
5230	
5230	""Of all the strange and wonderful--""
5230	
5230	""Exactly. But it's odd I should blunder into _your_ house to get my
5230	bandaging. My first stroke of luck! Anyhow I meant to sleep in this
5230	house to-night. You must stand that! It's a filthy nuisance, my
5230	blood showing, isn't it? Quite a clot over there. Gets visible as
5230	it coagulates, I see. It's only the living tissue I've changed, and
5230	only for as long as I'm alive.... I've been in the house three hours.""
5230	
5230	""But how's it done?"" began Kemp, in a tone of exasperation.
5230	""Confound it! The whole business--it's unreasonable from
5230	beginning to end.""
5230	
5230	""Quite reasonable,"" said the Invisible Man. ""Perfectly reasonable.""
5230	
5230	He reached over and secured the whiskey bottle. Kemp stared at the
5230	devouring dressing gown. A ray of candle-light penetrating a torn
5230	patch in the right shoulder, made a triangle of light under the
5230	left ribs. ""What were the shots?"" he asked. ""How did the shooting
5230	begin?""
5230	
5230	""There was a real fool of a man--a sort of confederate of
5230	mine--curse him!--who tried to steal my money. _Has_ done so.""
5230	
5230	""Is _he_ invisible too?""
5230	
5230	""No.""
5230	
5230	""Well?""
5230	
5230	""Can't I have some more to eat before I tell you all that? I'm
5230	hungry--in pain. And you want me to tell stories!""
5230	
5230	Kemp got up. ""_You_ didn't do any shooting?"" he asked.
5230	
5230	""Not me,"" said his visitor. ""Some fool I'd never seen fired at
5230	random. A lot of them got scared. They all got scared at me. Curse
5230	them!--I say--I want more to eat than this, Kemp.""
5230	
5230	""I'll see what there is to eat downstairs,"" said Kemp. ""Not much,
5230	I'm afraid.""
5230	
5230	After he had done eating, and he made a heavy meal, the Invisible
5230	Man demanded a cigar. He bit the end savagely before Kemp could
5230	find a knife, and cursed when the outer leaf loosened. It was
5230	strange to see him smoking; his mouth, and throat, pharynx and
5230	nares, became visible as a sort of whirling smoke cast.
5230	
5230	""This blessed gift of smoking!"" he said, and puffed vigorously.
5230	""I'm lucky to have fallen upon you, Kemp. You must help me. Fancy
5230	tumbling on you just now! I'm in a devilish scrape--I've been mad,
5230	I think. The things I have been through! But we will do things yet.
5230	Let me tell you--""
5230	
5230	He helped himself to more whiskey and soda. Kemp got up, looked
5230	about him, and fetched a glass from his spare room. ""It's wild--but
5230	I suppose I may drink.""
5230	
5230	""You haven't changed much, Kemp, these dozen years. You fair men
5230	don't. Cool and methodical--after the first collapse. I must tell
5230	you. We will work together!""
5230	
5230	""But how was it all done?"" said Kemp, ""and how did you get like
5230	this?""
5230	
5230	""For God's sake, let me smoke in peace for a little while! And then
5230	I will begin to tell you.""
5230	
5230	But the story was not told that night. The Invisible Man's wrist
5230	was growing painful; he was feverish, exhausted, and his mind came
5230	round to brood upon his chase down the hill and the struggle about
5230	the inn. He spoke in fragments of Marvel, he smoked faster, his
5230	voice grew angry. Kemp tried to gather what he could.
5230	
5230	""He was afraid of me, I could see that he was afraid of me,"" said
5230	the Invisible Man many times over. ""He meant to give me the slip--he
5230	was always casting about! What a fool I was!
5230	
5230	""The cur!
5230	
5230	""I should have killed him!""
5230	
5230	""Where did you get the money?"" asked Kemp, abruptly.
5230	
5230	The Invisible Man was silent for a space. ""I can't tell you
5230	to-night,"" he said.
5230	
5230	He groaned suddenly and leant forward, supporting his invisible
5230	head on invisible hands. ""Kemp,"" he said, ""I've had no sleep for
5230	near three days, except a couple of dozes of an hour or so. I
5230	must sleep soon.""
5230	
5230	""Well, have my room--have this room.""
5230	
5230	""But how can I sleep? If I sleep--he will get away. Ugh! What
5230	does it matter?""
5230	
5230	""What's the shot wound?"" asked Kemp, abruptly.
5230	
5230	""Nothing--scratch and blood. Oh, God! How I want sleep!""
5230	
5230	""Why not?""
5230	
5230	The Invisible Man appeared to be regarding Kemp. ""Because I've a
5230	particular objection to being caught by my fellow-men,"" he said
5230	slowly.
5230	
5230	Kemp started.
5230	
5230	""Fool that I am!"" said the Invisible Man, striking the table
5230	smartly. ""I've put the idea into your head.""

5230	CHAPTER XVIII
5230	
5230	THE INVISIBLE MAN SLEEPS
5230	
5230	
5230	Exhausted and wounded as the Invisible Man was, he refused to accept
5230	Kemp's word that his freedom should be respected. He examined the
5230	two windows of the bedroom, drew up the blinds and opened the
5230	sashes, to confirm Kemp's statement that a retreat by them would be
5230	possible. Outside the night was very quiet and still, and the new
5230	moon was setting over the down. Then he examined the keys of the
5230	bedroom and the two dressing-room doors, to satisfy himself that
5230	these also could be made an assurance of freedom. Finally he
5230	expressed himself satisfied. He stood on the hearth rug and Kemp
5230	heard the sound of a yawn.
5230	
5230	""I'm sorry,"" said the Invisible Man, ""if I cannot tell you all that
5230	I have done to-night. But I am worn out. It's grotesque, no doubt.
5230	It's horrible! But believe me, Kemp, in spite of your arguments of
5230	this morning, it is quite a possible thing. I have made a discovery.
5230	I meant to keep it to myself. I can't. I must have a partner. And
5230	you.... We can do such things ... But to-morrow. Now, Kemp, I feel
5230	as though I must sleep or perish.""
5230	
5230	Kemp stood in the middle of the room staring at the headless garment.
5230	""I suppose I must leave you,"" he said. ""It's--incredible. Three
5230	things happening like this, overturning all my preconceptions--would
5230	make me insane. But it's real! Is there anything more that I can
5230	get you?""
5230	
5230	""Only bid me good-night,"" said Griffin.
5230	
5230	""Good-night,"" said Kemp, and shook an invisible hand. He walked
5230	sideways to the door. Suddenly the dressing-gown walked quickly
5230	towards him. ""Understand me!"" said the dressing-gown. ""No attempts
5230	to hamper me, or capture me! Or--""
5230	
5230	Kemp's face changed a little. ""I thought I gave you my word,"" he
5230	said.
5230	
5230	Kemp closed the door softly behind him, and the key was turned upon
5230	him forthwith. Then, as he stood with an expression of passive
5230	amazement on his face, the rapid feet came to the door of the
5230	dressing-room and that too was locked. Kemp slapped his brow with
5230	his hand. ""Am I dreaming? Has the world gone mad--or have I?""
5230	
5230	He laughed, and put his hand to the locked door. ""Barred out of my
5230	own bedroom, by a flagrant absurdity!"" he said.
5230	
5230	He walked to the head of the staircase, turned, and stared at the
5230	locked doors. ""It's fact,"" he said. He put his fingers to his
5230	slightly bruised neck. ""Undeniable fact!
5230	
5230	""But--""
5230	
5230	He shook his head hopelessly, turned, and went downstairs.
5230	
5230	He lit the dining-room lamp, got out a cigar, and began pacing the
5230	room, ejaculating. Now and then he would argue with himself.
5230	
5230	""Invisible!"" he said.
5230	
5230	""Is there such a thing as an invisible animal? ... In the sea, yes.
5230	Thousands--millions. All the larvae, all the little nauplii and
5230	tornarias, all the microscopic things, the jelly-fish. In the sea
5230	there are more things invisible than visible! I never thought of
5230	that before. And in the ponds too! All those little pond-life
5230	things--specks of colourless translucent jelly! But in air? No!
5230	
5230	""It can't be.
5230	
5230	""But after all--why not?
5230	
5230	""If a man was made of glass he would still be visible.""
5230	
5230	His meditation became profound. The bulk of three cigars had passed
5230	into the invisible or diffused as a white ash over the carpet before
5230	he spoke again. Then it was merely an exclamation. He turned aside,
5230	walked out of the room, and went into his little consulting-room and
5230	lit the gas there. It was a little room, because Dr. Kemp did not
5230	live by practice, and in it were the day's newspapers. The morning's
5230	paper lay carelessly opened and thrown aside. He caught it up,
5230	turned it over, and read the account of a ""Strange Story from Iping""
5230	that the mariner at Port Stowe had spelt over so painfully to Mr.
5230	Marvel. Kemp read it swiftly.
5230	
5230	""Wrapped up!"" said Kemp. ""Disguised! Hiding it! 'No one seems to
5230	have been aware of his misfortune.' What the devil _is_ his game?""
5230	
5230	He dropped the paper, and his eye went seeking. ""Ah!"" he said, and
5230	caught up the _St. James' Gazette_, lying folded up as it arrived.
5230	""Now we shall get at the truth,"" said Dr. Kemp. He rent the paper
5230	open; a couple of columns confronted him. ""An Entire Village in
5230	Sussex goes Mad"" was the heading.
5230	
5230	""Good Heavens!"" said Kemp, reading eagerly an incredulous account
5230	of the events in Iping, of the previous afternoon, that have
5230	already been described. Over the leaf the report in the morning
5230	paper had been reprinted.
5230	
5230	He re-read it. ""Ran through the streets striking right and left.
5230	Jaffers insensible. Mr. Huxter in great pain--still unable to
5230	describe what he saw. Painful humiliation--vicar. Woman ill with
5230	terror! Windows smashed. This extraordinary story probably a
5230	fabrication. Too good not to print--_cum grano_!""
5230	
5230	He dropped the paper and stared blankly in front of him. ""Probably
5230	a fabrication!""
5230	
5230	He caught up the paper again, and re-read the whole business. ""But
5230	when does the Tramp come in? Why the deuce was he chasing a tramp?""
5230	
5230	He sat down abruptly on the surgical bench. ""He's not only
5230	invisible,"" he said, ""but he's mad! Homicidal!""
5230	
5230	When dawn came to mingle its pallor with the lamp-light and cigar
5230	smoke of the dining-room, Kemp was still pacing up and down, trying
5230	to grasp the incredible.
5230	
5230	He was altogether too excited to sleep. His servants, descending
5230	sleepily, discovered him, and were inclined to think that
5230	over-study had worked this ill on him. He gave them extraordinary
5230	but quite explicit instructions to lay breakfast for two in the
5230	belvedere study--and then to confine themselves to the basement
5230	and ground-floor. Then he continued to pace the dining-room until
5230	the morning's paper came. That had much to say and little to tell,
5230	beyond the confirmation of the evening before, and a very badly
5230	written account of another remarkable tale from Port Burdock. This
5230	gave Kemp the essence of the happenings at the ""Jolly Cricketers,""
5230	and the name of Marvel. ""He has made me keep with him twenty-four
5230	hours,"" Marvel testified. Certain minor facts were added to the
5230	Iping story, notably the cutting of the village telegraph-wire.
5230	But there was nothing to throw light on the connexion between
5230	the Invisible Man and the Tramp; for Mr. Marvel had supplied no
5230	information about the three books, or the money with which he was
5230	lined. The incredulous tone had vanished and a shoal of reporters
5230	and inquirers were already at work elaborating the matter.
5230	
5230	Kemp read every scrap of the report and sent his housemaid out to
5230	get every one of the morning papers she could. These also he
5230	devoured.
5230	
5230	""He is invisible!"" he said. ""And it reads like rage growing to
5230	mania! The things he may do! The things he may do! And he's
5230	upstairs free as the air. What on earth ought I to do?""
5230	
5230	""For instance, would it be a breach of faith if--? No.""
5230	
5230	He went to a little untidy desk in the corner, and began a note. He
5230	tore this up half written, and wrote another. He read it over and
5230	considered it. Then he took an envelope and addressed it to ""Colonel
5230	Adye, Port Burdock.""
5230	
5230	The Invisible Man awoke even as Kemp was doing this. He awoke in an
5230	evil temper, and Kemp, alert for every sound, heard his pattering
5230	feet rush suddenly across the bedroom overhead. Then a chair was
5230	flung over and the wash-hand stand tumbler smashed. Kemp hurried
5230	upstairs and rapped eagerly.
5230	
5230	
5230	
5230	CHAPTER XIX
5230	
5230	CERTAIN FIRST PRINCIPLES
5230	
5230	
5230	""What's the matter?"" asked Kemp, when the Invisible Man admitted him.
5230	
5230	""Nothing,"" was the answer.
5230	
5230	""But, confound it! The smash?""
5230	
5230	""Fit of temper,"" said the Invisible Man. ""Forgot this arm; and it's
5230	sore.""
5230	
5230	""You're rather liable to that sort of thing.""
5230	
5230	""I am.""
5230	
5230	Kemp walked across the room and picked up the fragments of broken
5230	glass. ""All the facts are out about you,"" said Kemp, standing up
5230	with the glass in his hand; ""all that happened in Iping, and down
5230	the hill. The world has become aware of its invisible citizen. But
5230	no one knows you are here.""
5230	
5230	The Invisible Man swore.
5230	
5230	""The secret's out. I gather it was a secret. I don't know what your
5230	plans are, but of course I'm anxious to help you.""
5230	
5230	The Invisible Man sat down on the bed.
5230	
5230	""There's breakfast upstairs,"" said Kemp, speaking as easily as
5230	possible, and he was delighted to find his strange guest rose
5230	willingly. Kemp led the way up the narrow staircase to the
5230	belvedere.
5230	
5230	""Before we can do anything else,"" said Kemp, ""I must understand a
5230	little more about this invisibility of yours."" He had sat down,
5230	after one nervous glance out of the window, with the air of a man
5230	who has talking to do. His doubts of the sanity of the entire
5230	business flashed and vanished again as he looked across to
5230	where Griffin sat at the breakfast-table--a headless, handless
5230	dressing-gown, wiping unseen lips on a miraculously held serviette.
5230	
5230	""It's simple enough--and credible enough,"" said Griffin, putting
5230	the serviette aside and leaning the invisible head on an invisible
5230	hand.
5230	
5230	""No doubt, to you, but--"" Kemp laughed.
5230	
5230	""Well, yes; to me it seemed wonderful at first, no doubt. But now,
5230	great God! ... But we will do great things yet! I came on the stuff
5230	first at Chesilstowe.""
5230	
5230	""Chesilstowe?""
5230	
5230	""I went there after I left London. You know I dropped medicine and
5230	took up physics? No; well, I did. _Light_ fascinated me.""
5230	
5230	""Ah!""
5230	
5230	""Optical density! The whole subject is a network of riddles--a
5230	network with solutions glimmering elusively through. And being but
5230	two-and-twenty and full of enthusiasm, I said, 'I will devote my
5230	life to this. This is worth while.' You know what fools we are at
5230	two-and-twenty?""
5230	
5230	""Fools then or fools now,"" said Kemp.
5230	
5230	""As though knowing could be any satisfaction to a man!
5230	
5230	""But I went to work--like a slave. And I had hardly worked and
5230	thought about the matter six months before light came through one
5230	of the meshes suddenly--blindingly! I found a general principle
5230	of pigments and refraction--a formula, a geometrical expression
5230	involving four dimensions. Fools, common men, even common
5230	mathematicians, do not know anything of what some general expression
5230	may mean to the student of molecular physics. In the books--the
5230	books that tramp has hidden--there are marvels, miracles! But this
5230	was not a method, it was an idea, that might lead to a method by
5230	which it would be possible, without changing any other property of
5230	matter--except, in some instances colours--to lower the refractive
5230	index of a substance, solid or liquid, to that of air--so far as all
5230	practical purposes are concerned.""
5230	
5230	""Phew!"" said Kemp. ""That's odd! But still I don't see quite ... I
5230	can understand that thereby you could spoil a valuable stone, but
5230	personal invisibility is a far cry.""
5230	
5230	""Precisely,"" said Griffin. ""But consider, visibility depends on the
5230	action of the visible bodies on light. Either a body absorbs light,
5230	or it reflects or refracts it, or does all these things. If it
5230	neither reflects nor refracts nor absorbs light, it cannot of
5230	itself be visible. You see an opaque red box, for instance, because
5230	the colour absorbs some of the light and reflects the rest, all the
5230	red part of the light, to you. If it did not absorb any particular
5230	part of the light, but reflected it all, then it would be a shining
5230	white box. Silver! A diamond box would neither absorb much of the
5230	light nor reflect much from the general surface, but just here
5230	and there where the surfaces were favourable the light would
5230	be reflected and refracted, so that you would get a brilliant
5230	appearance of flashing reflections and translucencies--a sort of
5230	skeleton of light. A glass box would not be so brilliant, nor so
5230	clearly visible, as a diamond box, because there would be less
5230	refraction and reflection. See that? From certain points of view
5230	you would see quite clearly through it. Some kinds of glass would
5230	be more visible than others, a box of flint glass would be brighter
5230	than a box of ordinary window glass. A box of very thin common
5230	glass would be hard to see in a bad light, because it would absorb
5230	hardly any light and refract and reflect very little. And if you
5230	put a sheet of common white glass in water, still more if you
5230	put it in some denser liquid than water, it would vanish almost
5230	altogether, because light passing from water to glass is only
5230	slightly refracted or reflected or indeed affected in any way.
5230	It is almost as invisible as a jet of coal gas or hydrogen is in
5230	air. And for precisely the same reason!""
5230	
5230	""Yes,"" said Kemp, ""that is pretty plain sailing.""
5230	
5230	""And here is another fact you will know to be true. If a sheet of
5230	glass is smashed, Kemp, and beaten into a powder, it becomes much
5230	more visible while it is in the air; it becomes at last an opaque
5230	white powder. This is because the powdering multiplies the surfaces
5230	of the glass at which refraction and reflection occur. In the sheet
5230	of glass there are only two surfaces; in the powder the light is
5230	reflected or refracted by each grain it passes through, and very
5230	little gets right through the powder. But if the white powdered
5230	glass is put into water, it forthwith vanishes. The powdered glass
5230	and water have much the same refractive index; that is, the light
5230	undergoes very little refraction or reflection in passing from one
5230	to the other.
5230	
5230	""You make the glass invisible by putting it into a liquid of nearly
5230	the same refractive index; a transparent thing becomes invisible if
5230	it is put in any medium of almost the same refractive index. And if
5230	you will consider only a second, you will see also that the powder
5230	of glass might be made to vanish in air, if its refractive index
5230	could be made the same as that of air; for then there would be no
5230	refraction or reflection as the light passed from glass to air.""
5230	
5230	""Yes, yes,"" said Kemp. ""But a man's not powdered glass!""
5230	
5230	""No,"" said Griffin. ""He's more transparent!""
5230	
5230	""Nonsense!""
5230	
5230	""That from a doctor! How one forgets! Have you already forgotten
5230	your physics, in ten years? Just think of all the things that are
5230	transparent and seem not to be so. Paper, for instance, is made up
5230	of transparent fibres, and it is white and opaque only for the same
5230	reason that a powder of glass is white and opaque. Oil white paper,
5230	fill up the interstices between the particles with oil so that there
5230	is no longer refraction or reflection except at the surfaces, and
5230	it becomes as transparent as glass. And not only paper, but cotton
5230	fibre, linen fibre, wool fibre, woody fibre, and _bone_, Kemp,
5230	_flesh_, Kemp, _hair_, Kemp, _nails_ and _nerves_, Kemp, in fact
5230	the whole fabric of a man except the red of his blood and the black
5230	pigment of hair, are all made up of transparent, colourless tissue.
5230	So little suffices to make us visible one to the other. For the
5230	most part the fibres of a living creature are no more opaque than
5230	water.""
5230	
5230	""Great Heavens!"" cried Kemp. ""Of course, of course! I was thinking
5230	only last night of the sea larvae and all jelly-fish!""
5230	
5230	""_Now_ you have me! And all that I knew and had in mind a year after
5230	I left London--six years ago. But I kept it to myself. I had to do
5230	my work under frightful disadvantages. Oliver, my professor, was a
5230	scientific bounder, a journalist by instinct, a thief of ideas--he
5230	was always prying! And you know the knavish system of the scientific
5230	world. I simply would not publish, and let him share my credit. I
5230	went on working; I got nearer and nearer making my formula into an
5230	experiment, a reality. I told no living soul, because I meant to
5230	flash my work upon the world with crushing effect and become famous
5230	at a blow. I took up the question of pigments to fill up certain
5230	gaps. And suddenly, not by design but by accident, I made a
5230	discovery in physiology.""
5230	
5230	""Yes?""
5230	
5230	""You know the red colouring matter of blood; it can be made
5230	white--colourless--and remain with all the functions it has now!""
5230	
5230	Kemp gave a cry of incredulous amazement.
5230	
5230	The Invisible Man rose and began pacing the little study. ""You may
5230	well exclaim. I remember that night. It was late at night--in the
5230	daytime one was bothered with the gaping, silly students--and I
5230	worked then sometimes till dawn. It came suddenly, splendid and
5230	complete in my mind. I was alone; the laboratory was still, with the
5230	tall lights burning brightly and silently. In all my great moments
5230	I have been alone. 'One could make an animal--a tissue--transparent!
5230	One could make it invisible! All except the pigments--I could be
5230	invisible!' I said, suddenly realising what it meant to be an albino
5230	with such knowledge. It was overwhelming. I left the filtering I was
5230	doing, and went and stared out of the great window at the stars.
5230	'I could be invisible!' I repeated.
5230	
5230	""To do such a thing would be to transcend magic. And I beheld,
5230	unclouded by doubt, a magnificent vision of all that invisibility
5230	might mean to a man--the mystery, the power, the freedom. Drawbacks
5230	I saw none. You have only to think! And I, a shabby, poverty-struck,
5230	hemmed-in demonstrator, teaching fools in a provincial college,
5230	might suddenly become--this. I ask you, Kemp if _you_ ... Anyone, I
5230	tell you, would have flung himself upon that research. And I worked
5230	three years, and every mountain of difficulty I toiled over showed
5230	another from its summit. The infinite details! And the exasperation!
5230	A professor, a provincial professor, always prying. 'When are you
5230	going to publish this work of yours?' was his everlasting question.
5230	And the students, the cramped means! Three years I had of it--
5230	
5230	""And after three years of secrecy and exasperation, I found that to
5230	complete it was impossible--impossible.""
5230	
5230	""How?"" asked Kemp.
5230	
5230	""Money,"" said the Invisible Man, and went again to stare out of the
5230	window.
5230	
5230	He turned around abruptly. ""I robbed the old man--robbed my
5230	father.
5230	
5230	""The money was not his, and he shot himself.""
5230	
5230	
5230	
5230	CHAPTER XX
5230	
5230	AT THE HOUSE IN GREAT PORTLAND STREET
5230	
5230	
5230	For a moment Kemp sat in silence, staring at the back of the
5230	headless figure at the window. Then he started, struck by a thought,
5230	rose, took the Invisible Man's arm, and turned him away from the
5230	outlook.
5230	
5230	""You are tired,"" he said, ""and while I sit, you walk about. Have
5230	my chair.""
5230	
5230	He placed himself between Griffin and the nearest window.
5230	
5230	For a space Griffin sat silent, and then he resumed abruptly:
5230	
5230	""I had left the Chesilstowe cottage already,"" he said, ""when that
5230	happened. It was last December. I had taken a room in London, a
5230	large unfurnished room in a big ill-managed lodging-house in a slum
5230	near Great Portland Street. The room was soon full of the appliances
5230	I had bought with his money; the work was going on steadily,
5230	successfully, drawing near an end. I was like a man emerging from a
5230	thicket, and suddenly coming on some unmeaning tragedy. I went to
5230	bury him. My mind was still on this research, and I did not lift
5230	a finger to save his character. I remember the funeral, the cheap
5230	hearse, the scant ceremony, the windy frost-bitten hillside, and the
5230	old college friend of his who read the service over him--a shabby,
5230	black, bent old man with a snivelling cold.
5230	
5230	""I remember walking back to the empty house, through the place that
5230	had once been a village and was now patched and tinkered by the
5230	jerry builders into the ugly likeness of a town. Every way the
5230	roads ran out at last into the desecrated fields and ended in
5230	rubble heaps and rank wet weeds. I remember myself as a gaunt black
5230	figure, going along the slippery, shiny pavement, and the strange
5230	sense of detachment I felt from the squalid respectability, the
5230	sordid commercialism of the place.
5230	
5230	""I did not feel a bit sorry for my father. He seemed to me to be
5230	the victim of his own foolish sentimentality. The current cant
5230	required my attendance at his funeral, but it was really not my
5230	affair.
5230	
5230	""But going along the High Street, my old life came back to me
5230	for a space, for I met the girl I had known ten years since.
5230	Our eyes met.
5230	
5230	""Something moved me to turn back and talk to her. She was a very
5230	ordinary person.
5230	
5230	""It was all like a dream, that visit to the old places. I did not
5230	feel then that I was lonely, that I had come out from the world
5230	into a desolate place. I appreciated my loss of sympathy, but I put
5230	it down to the general inanity of things. Re-entering my room
5230	seemed like the recovery of reality. There were the things I knew
5230	and loved. There stood the apparatus, the experiments arranged and
5230	waiting. And now there was scarcely a difficulty left, beyond the
5230	planning of details.
5230	
5230	""I will tell you, Kemp, sooner or later, all the complicated
5230	processes. We need not go into that now. For the most part, saving
5230	certain gaps I chose to remember, they are written in cypher in
5230	those books that tramp has hidden. We must hunt him down. We must
5230	get those books again. But the essential phase was to place the
5230	transparent object whose refractive index was to be lowered between
5230	two radiating centres of a sort of ethereal vibration, of which I
5230	will tell you more fully later. No, not those Roentgen vibrations--I
5230	don't know that these others of mine have been described. Yet
5230	they are obvious enough. I needed two little dynamos, and these I
5230	worked with a cheap gas engine. My first experiment was with a bit
5230	of white wool fabric. It was the strangest thing in the world to
5230	see it in the flicker of the flashes soft and white, and then to
5230	watch it fade like a wreath of smoke and vanish.
5230	
5230	""I could scarcely believe I had done it. I put my hand into the
5230	emptiness, and there was the thing as solid as ever. I felt it
5230	awkwardly, and threw it on the floor. I had a little trouble
5230	finding it again.
5230	
5230	""And then came a curious experience. I heard a miaow behind me, and
5230	turning, saw a lean white cat, very dirty, on the cistern cover
5230	outside the window. A thought came into my head. 'Everything ready
5230	for you,' I said, and went to the window, opened it, and called
5230	softly. She came in, purring--the poor beast was starving--and
5230	I gave her some milk. All my food was in a cupboard in the
5230	corner of the room. After that she went smelling round the room,
5230	evidently with the idea of making herself at home. The invisible
5230	rag upset her a bit; you should have seen her spit at it! But I
5230	made her comfortable on the pillow of my truckle-bed. And I gave
5230	her butter to get her to wash.""
5230	
5230	""And you processed her?""
5230	
5230	""I processed her. But giving drugs to a cat is no joke, Kemp! And
5230	the process failed.""
5230	
5230	""Failed!""
5230	
5230	""In two particulars. These were the claws and the pigment stuff,
5230	what is it?--at the back of the eye in a cat. You know?""
5230	
5230	""_Tapetum_.""
5230	
5230	""Yes, the _tapetum_. It didn't go. After I'd given the stuff to
5230	bleach the blood and done certain other things to her, I gave the
5230	beast opium, and put her and the pillow she was sleeping on, on the
5230	apparatus. And after all the rest had faded and vanished, there
5230	remained two little ghosts of her eyes.""
5230	
5230	""Odd!""
5230	
5230	""I can't explain it. She was bandaged and clamped, of course--so
5230	I had her safe; but she woke while she was still misty, and miaowed
5230	dismally, and someone came knocking. It was an old woman from
5230	downstairs, who suspected me of vivisecting--a drink-sodden old
5230	creature, with only a white cat to care for in all the world. I
5230	whipped out some chloroform, applied it, and answered the door.
5230	'Did I hear a cat?' she asked. 'My cat?' 'Not here,' said I, very
5230	politely. She was a little doubtful and tried to peer past me into
5230	the room; strange enough to her no doubt--bare walls, uncurtained
5230	windows, truckle-bed, with the gas engine vibrating, and the
5230	seethe of the radiant points, and that faint ghastly stinging of
5230	chloroform in the air. She had to be satisfied at last and went
5230	away again.""
5230	
5230	""How long did it take?"" asked Kemp.
5230	
5230	""Three or four hours--the cat. The bones and sinews and the fat
5230	were the last to go, and the tips of the coloured hairs. And, as I
5230	say, the back part of the eye, tough, iridescent stuff it is,
5230	wouldn't go at all.
5230	
5230	""It was night outside long before the business was over, and nothing
5230	was to be seen but the dim eyes and the claws. I stopped the gas
5230	engine, felt for and stroked the beast, which was still insensible,
5230	and then, being tired, left it sleeping on the invisible pillow and
5230	went to bed. I found it hard to sleep. I lay awake thinking weak
5230	aimless stuff, going over the experiment over and over again, or
5230	dreaming feverishly of things growing misty and vanishing about me,
5230	until everything, the ground I stood on, vanished, and so I came to
5230	that sickly falling nightmare one gets. About two, the cat began
5230	miaowing about the room. I tried to hush it by talking to it, and
5230	then I decided to turn it out. I remember the shock I had when
5230	striking a light--there were just the round eyes shining green--and
5230	nothing round them. I would have given it milk, but I hadn't any. It
5230	wouldn't be quiet, it just sat down and miaowed at the door. I tried
5230	to catch it, with an idea of putting it out of the window, but it
5230	wouldn't be caught, it vanished. Then it began miaowing in different
5230	parts of the room. At last I opened the window and made a bustle. I
5230	suppose it went out at last. I never saw any more of it.
5230	
5230	""Then--Heaven knows why--I fell thinking of my father's funeral
5230	again, and the dismal windy hillside, until the day had come. I
5230	found sleeping was hopeless, and, locking my door after me,
5230	wandered out into the morning streets.""
5230	
5230	""You don't mean to say there's an invisible cat at large!"" said
5230	Kemp.
5230	
5230	""If it hasn't been killed,"" said the Invisible Man. ""Why not?""
5230	
5230	""Why not?"" said Kemp. ""I didn't mean to interrupt.""
5230	
5230	""It's very probably been killed,"" said the Invisible Man. ""It
5230	was alive four days after, I know, and down a grating in Great
5230	Titchfield Street; because I saw a crowd round the place, trying
5230	to see whence the miaowing came.""
5230	
5230	He was silent for the best part of a minute. Then he resumed
5230	abruptly:
5230	
5230	""I remember that morning before the change very vividly. I must have
5230	gone up Great Portland Street. I remember the barracks in Albany
5230	Street, and the horse soldiers coming out, and at last I found the
5230	summit of Primrose Hill. It was a sunny day in January--one of those
5230	sunny, frosty days that came before the snow this year. My weary
5230	brain tried to formulate the position, to plot out a plan of action.
5230	
5230	""I was surprised to find, now that my prize was within my grasp, how
5230	inconclusive its attainment seemed. As a matter of fact I was worked
5230	out; the intense stress of nearly four years' continuous work left
5230	me incapable of any strength of feeling. I was apathetic, and I
5230	tried in vain to recover the enthusiasm of my first inquiries,
5230	the passion of discovery that had enabled me to compass even the
5230	downfall of my father's grey hairs. Nothing seemed to matter. I saw
5230	pretty clearly this was a transient mood, due to overwork and want
5230	of sleep, and that either by drugs or rest it would be possible to
5230	recover my energies.
5230	
5230	""All I could think clearly was that the thing had to be carried
5230	through; the fixed idea still ruled me. And soon, for the money I
5230	had was almost exhausted. I looked about me at the hillside, with
5230	children playing and girls watching them, and tried to think of all
5230	the fantastic advantages an invisible man would have in the world.
5230	After a time I crawled home, took some food and a strong dose of
5230	strychnine, and went to sleep in my clothes on my unmade bed.
5230	Strychnine is a grand tonic, Kemp, to take the flabbiness out of
5230	a man.""
5230	
5230	""It's the devil,"" said Kemp. ""It's the palaeolithic in a bottle.""
5230	
5230	""I awoke vastly invigorated and rather irritable. You know?""
5230	
5230	""I know the stuff.""
5230	
5230	""And there was someone rapping at the door. It was my landlord
5230	with threats and inquiries, an old Polish Jew in a long grey coat
5230	and greasy slippers. I had been tormenting a cat in the night, he
5230	was sure--the old woman's tongue had been busy. He insisted on
5230	knowing all about it. The laws in this country against vivisection
5230	were very severe--he might be liable. I denied the cat. Then the
5230	vibration of the little gas engine could be felt all over the
5230	house, he said. That was true, certainly. He edged round me into
5230	the room, peering about over his German-silver spectacles, and a
5230	sudden dread came into my mind that he might carry away something
5230	of my secret. I tried to keep between him and the concentrating
5230	apparatus I had arranged, and that only made him more curious. What
5230	was I doing? Why was I always alone and secretive? Was it legal?
5230	Was it dangerous? I paid nothing but the usual rent. His had always
5230	been a most respectable house--in a disreputable neighbourhood.
5230	Suddenly my temper gave way. I told him to get out. He began to
5230	protest, to jabber of his right of entry. In a moment I had him by
5230	the collar; something ripped, and he went spinning out into his own
5230	passage. I slammed and locked the door and sat down quivering.
5230	
5230	""He made a fuss outside, which I disregarded, and after a time he
5230	went away.
5230	
5230	""But this brought matters to a crisis. I did not know what he
5230	would do, nor even what he had the power to do. To move to fresh
5230	apartments would have meant delay; altogether I had barely twenty
5230	pounds left in the world, for the most part in a bank--and I
5230	could not afford that. Vanish! It was irresistible. Then there
5230	would be an inquiry, the sacking of my room.
5230	
5230	""At the thought of the possibility of my work being exposed or
5230	interrupted at its very climax, I became very angry and active. I
5230	hurried out with my three books of notes, my cheque-book--the tramp
5230	has them now--and directed them from the nearest Post Office to a
5230	house of call for letters and parcels in Great Portland Street. I
5230	tried to go out noiselessly. Coming in, I found my landlord going
5230	quietly upstairs; he had heard the door close, I suppose. You would
5230	have laughed to see him jump aside on the landing as I came tearing
5230	after him. He glared at me as I went by him, and I made the house
5230	quiver with the slamming of my door. I heard him come shuffling up
5230	to my floor, hesitate, and go down. I set to work upon my
5230	preparations forthwith.
5230	
5230	""It was all done that evening and night. While I was still sitting
5230	under the sickly, drowsy influence of the drugs that decolourise
5230	blood, there came a repeated knocking at the door. It ceased,
5230	footsteps went away and returned, and the knocking was resumed.
5230	There was an attempt to push something under the door--a blue
5230	paper. Then in a fit of irritation I rose and went and flung the
5230	door wide open. 'Now then?' said I.
5230	
5230	""It was my landlord, with a notice of ejectment or something. He
5230	held it out to me, saw something odd about my hands, I expect, and
5230	lifted his eyes to my face.
5230	
5230	""For a moment he gaped. Then he gave a sort of inarticulate cry,
5230	dropped candle and writ together, and went blundering down the dark
5230	passage to the stairs. I shut the door, locked it, and went to the
5230	looking-glass. Then I understood his terror.... My face was
5230	white--like white stone.
5230	
5230	""But it was all horrible. I had not expected the suffering. A night
5230	of racking anguish, sickness and fainting. I set my teeth, though my
5230	skin was presently afire, all my body afire; but I lay there like
5230	grim death. I understood now how it was the cat had howled until I
5230	chloroformed it. Lucky it was I lived alone and untended in my room.
5230	There were times when I sobbed and groaned and talked. But I stuck
5230	to it.... I became insensible and woke languid in the darkness.
5230	
5230	""The pain had passed. I thought I was killing myself and I did not
5230	care. I shall never forget that dawn, and the strange horror of
5230	seeing that my hands had become as clouded glass, and watching them
5230	grow clearer and thinner as the day went by, until at last I could
5230	see the sickly disorder of my room through them, though I closed my
5230	transparent eyelids. My limbs became glassy, the bones and arteries
5230	faded, vanished, and the little white nerves went last. I gritted
5230	my teeth and stayed there to the end. At last only the dead tips of
5230	the fingernails remained, pallid and white, and the brown stain of
5230	some acid upon my fingers.
5230	
5230	""I struggled up. At first I was as incapable as a swathed
5230	infant--stepping with limbs I could not see. I was weak and very
5230	hungry. I went and stared at nothing in my shaving-glass, at nothing
5230	save where an attenuated pigment still remained behind the retina of
5230	my eyes, fainter than mist. I had to hang on to the table and press
5230	my forehead against the glass.
5230	
5230	""It was only by a frantic effort of will that I dragged myself back
5230	to the apparatus and completed the process.
5230	
5230	""I slept during the forenoon, pulling the sheet over my eyes to shut
5230	out the light, and about midday I was awakened again by a knocking.
5230	My strength had returned. I sat up and listened and heard a
5230	whispering. I sprang to my feet and as noiselessly as possible began
5230	to detach the connections of my apparatus, and to distribute it
5230	about the room, so as to destroy the suggestions of its arrangement.
5230	Presently the knocking was renewed and voices called, first my
5230	landlord's, and then two others. To gain time I answered them. The
5230	invisible rag and pillow came to hand and I opened the window and
5230	pitched them out on to the cistern cover. As the window opened, a
5230	heavy crash came at the door. Someone had charged it with the idea
5230	of smashing the lock. But the stout bolts I had screwed up some
5230	days before stopped him. That startled me, made me angry. I began
5230	to tremble and do things hurriedly.
5230	
5230	""I tossed together some loose paper, straw, packing paper and so
5230	forth, in the middle of the room, and turned on the gas. Heavy
5230	blows began to rain upon the door. I could not find the matches. I
5230	beat my hands on the wall with rage. I turned down the gas again,
5230	stepped out of the window on the cistern cover, very softly lowered
5230	the sash, and sat down, secure and invisible, but quivering with
5230	anger, to watch events. They split a panel, I saw, and in another
5230	moment they had broken away the staples of the bolts and stood in
5230	the open doorway. It was the landlord and his two step-sons, sturdy
5230	young men of three or four and twenty. Behind them fluttered the
5230	old hag of a woman from downstairs.
5230	
5230	""You may imagine their astonishment to find the room empty. One of
5230	the younger men rushed to the window at once, flung it up and stared
5230	out. His staring eyes and thick-lipped bearded face came a foot
5230	from my face. I was half minded to hit his silly countenance, but I
5230	arrested my doubled fist. He stared right through me. So did the
5230	others as they joined him. The old man went and peered under the
5230	bed, and then they all made a rush for the cupboard. They had to
5230	argue about it at length in Yiddish and Cockney English. They
5230	concluded I had not answered them, that their imagination had
5230	deceived them. A feeling of extraordinary elation took the place
5230	of my anger as I sat outside the window and watched these four
5230	people--for the old lady came in, glancing suspiciously about her
5230	like a cat, trying to understand the riddle of my behaviour.
5230	
5230	""The old man, so far as I could understand his _patois_, agreed with
5230	the old lady that I was a vivisectionist. The sons protested in
5230	garbled English that I was an electrician, and appealed to the
5230	dynamos and radiators. They were all nervous about my arrival,
5230	although I found subsequently that they had bolted the front door.
5230	The old lady peered into the cupboard and under the bed, and one of
5230	the young men pushed up the register and stared up the chimney. One
5230	of my fellow lodgers, a coster-monger who shared the opposite room
5230	with a butcher, appeared on the landing, and he was called in and
5230	told incoherent things.
5230	
5230	""It occurred to me that the radiators, if they fell into the hands
5230	of some acute well-educated person, would give me away too much,
5230	and watching my opportunity, I came into the room and tilted one of
5230	the little dynamos off its fellow on which it was standing, and
5230	smashed both apparatus. Then, while they were trying to explain the
5230	smash, I dodged out of the room and went softly downstairs.
5230	
5230	""I went into one of the sitting-rooms and waited until they came
5230	down, still speculating and argumentative, all a little disappointed
5230	at finding no 'horrors,' and all a little puzzled how they stood
5230	legally towards me. Then I slipped up again with a box of matches,
5230	fired my heap of paper and rubbish, put the chairs and bedding
5230	thereby, led the gas to the affair, by means of an india-rubber
5230	tube, and waving a farewell to the room left it for the last time.""
5230	
5230	""You fired the house!"" exclaimed Kemp.
5230	
5230	""Fired the house. It was the only way to cover my trail--and no
5230	doubt it was insured. I slipped the bolts of the front door quietly
5230	and went out into the street. I was invisible, and I was only just
5230	beginning to realise the extraordinary advantage my invisibility
5230	gave me. My head was already teeming with plans of all the wild and
5230	wonderful things I had now impunity to do.""
5230	
5230	
5230	
5230	CHAPTER XXI
5230	
5230	IN OXFORD STREET
5230	
5230	
5230	""In going downstairs the first time I found an unexpected difficulty
5230	because I could not see my feet; indeed I stumbled twice, and there
5230	was an unaccustomed clumsiness in gripping the bolt. By not looking
5230	down, however, I managed to walk on the level passably well.
5230	
5230	""My mood, I say, was one of exaltation. I felt as a seeing man
5230	might do, with padded feet and noiseless clothes, in a city of the
5230	blind. I experienced a wild impulse to jest, to startle people, to
5230	clap men on the back, fling people's hats astray, and generally
5230	revel in my extraordinary advantage.
5230	
5230	""But hardly had I emerged upon Great Portland Street, however (my
5230	lodging was close to the big draper's shop there), when I heard a
5230	clashing concussion and was hit violently behind, and turning saw
5230	a man carrying a basket of soda-water syphons, and looking in
5230	amazement at his burden. Although the blow had really hurt me, I
5230	found something so irresistible in his astonishment that I laughed
5230	aloud. 'The devil's in the basket,' I said, and suddenly twisted
5230	it out of his hand. He let go incontinently, and I swung the whole
5230	weight into the air.
5230	
5230	""But a fool of a cabman, standing outside a public house, made a
5230	sudden rush for this, and his extending fingers took me with
5230	excruciating violence under the ear. I let the whole down with a
5230	smash on the cabman, and then, with shouts and the clatter of feet
5230	about me, people coming out of shops, vehicles pulling up, I
5230	realised what I had done for myself, and cursing my folly, backed
5230	against a shop window and prepared to dodge out of the confusion. In
5230	a moment I should be wedged into a crowd and inevitably discovered.
5230	I pushed by a butcher boy, who luckily did not turn to see the
5230	nothingness that shoved him aside, and dodged behind the cab-man's
5230	four-wheeler. I do not know how they settled the business. I hurried
5230	straight across the road, which was happily clear, and hardly
5230	heeding which way I went, in the fright of detection the incident
5230	had given me, plunged into the afternoon throng of Oxford Street.
5230	
5230	""I tried to get into the stream of people, but they were too thick
5230	for me, and in a moment my heels were being trodden upon. I took to
5230	the gutter, the roughness of which I found painful to my feet, and
5230	forthwith the shaft of a crawling hansom dug me forcibly under the
5230	shoulder blade, reminding me that I was already bruised severely. I
5230	staggered out of the way of the cab, avoided a perambulator by a
5230	convulsive movement, and found myself behind the hansom. A happy
5230	thought saved me, and as this drove slowly along I followed in its
5230	immediate wake, trembling and astonished at the turn of my
5230	adventure. And not only trembling, but shivering. It was a bright
5230	day in January and I was stark naked and the thin slime of mud that
5230	covered the road was freezing. Foolish as it seems to me now, I had
5230	not reckoned that, transparent or not, I was still amenable to the
5230	weather and all its consequences.
5230	
5230	""Then suddenly a bright idea came into my head. I ran round and got
5230	into the cab. And so, shivering, scared, and sniffing with the first
5230	intimations of a cold, and with the bruises in the small of my back
5230	growing upon my attention, I drove slowly along Oxford Street and
5230	past Tottenham Court Road. My mood was as different from that in
5230	which I had sallied forth ten minutes ago as it is possible to
5230	imagine. This invisibility indeed! The one thought that possessed
5230	me was--how was I to get out of the scrape I was in.
5230	
5230	""We crawled past Mudie's, and there a tall woman with five or six
5230	yellow-labelled books hailed my cab, and I sprang out just in time
5230	to escape her, shaving a railway van narrowly in my flight. I made
5230	off up the roadway to Bloomsbury Square, intending to strike north
5230	past the Museum and so get into the quiet district. I was now
5230	cruelly chilled, and the strangeness of my situation so unnerved me
5230	that I whimpered as I ran. At the northward corner of the Square a
5230	little white dog ran out of the Pharmaceutical Society's offices,
5230	and incontinently made for me, nose down.
5230	
5230	""I had never realised it before, but the nose is to the mind of a
5230	dog what the eye is to the mind of a seeing man. Dogs perceive the
5230	scent of a man moving as men perceive his vision. This brute began
5230	barking and leaping, showing, as it seemed to me, only too plainly
5230	that he was aware of me. I crossed Great Russell Street, glancing
5230	over my shoulder as I did so, and went some way along Montague
5230	Street before I realised what I was running towards.
5230	
5230	""Then I became aware of a blare of music, and looking along the
5230	street saw a number of people advancing out of Russell Square, red
5230	shirts, and the banner of the Salvation Army to the fore. Such a
5230	crowd, chanting in the roadway and scoffing on the pavement, I
5230	could not hope to penetrate, and dreading to go back and farther
5230	from home again, and deciding on the spur of the moment, I ran up
5230	the white steps of a house facing the museum railings, and stood
5230	there until the crowd should have passed. Happily the dog stopped
5230	at the noise of the band too, hesitated, and turned tail, running
5230	back to Bloomsbury Square again.
5230	
5230	""On came the band, bawling with unconscious irony some hymn about
5230	'When shall we see His face?' and it seemed an interminable time
5230	to me before the tide of the crowd washed along the pavement by me.
5230	Thud, thud, thud, came the drum with a vibrating resonance, and for
5230	the moment I did not notice two urchins stopping at the railings by
5230	me. 'See 'em,' said one. 'See what?' said the other. 'Why--them
5230	footmarks--bare. Like what you makes in mud.'
5230	
5230	""I looked down and saw the youngsters had stopped and were gaping
5230	at the muddy footmarks I had left behind me up the newly whitened
5230	steps. The passing people elbowed and jostled them, but their
5230	confounded intelligence was arrested. 'Thud, thud, thud, when,
5230	thud, shall we see, thud, his face, thud, thud.' 'There's a
5230	barefoot man gone up them steps, or I don't know nothing,' said
5230	one. 'And he ain't never come down again. And his foot was
5230	a-bleeding.'
5230	
5230	""The thick of the crowd had already passed. 'Looky there, Ted,'
5230	quoth the younger of the detectives, with the sharpness of surprise
5230	in his voice, and pointed straight to my feet. I looked down and
5230	saw at once the dim suggestion of their outline sketched in
5230	splashes of mud. For a moment I was paralysed.
5230	
5230	""'Why, that's rum,' said the elder. 'Dashed rum! It's just like
5230	the ghost of a foot, ain't it?' He hesitated and advanced with
5230	outstretched hand. A man pulled up short to see what he was
5230	catching, and then a girl. In another moment he would have touched
5230	me. Then I saw what to do. I made a step, the boy started back with
5230	an exclamation, and with a rapid movement I swung myself over into
5230	the portico of the next house. But the smaller boy was sharp-eyed
5230	enough to follow the movement, and before I was well down the
5230	steps and upon the pavement, he had recovered from his momentary
5230	astonishment and was shouting out that the feet had gone over the
5230	wall.
5230	
5230	""They rushed round and saw my new footmarks flash into being on the
5230	lower step and upon the pavement. 'What's up?' asked someone.
5230	'Feet! Look! Feet running!'
5230	
5230	""Everybody in the road, except my three pursuers, was pouring along
5230	after the Salvation Army, and this blow not only impeded me but them.
5230	There was an eddy of surprise and interrogation. At the cost of
5230	bowling over one young fellow I got through, and in another moment
5230	I was rushing headlong round the circuit of Russell Square, with
5230	six or seven astonished people following my footmarks. There was
5230	no time for explanation, or else the whole host would have been
5230	after me.
5230	
5230	""Twice I doubled round corners, thrice I crossed the road and came
5230	back upon my tracks, and then, as my feet grew hot and dry, the
5230	damp impressions began to fade. At last I had a breathing space
5230	and rubbed my feet clean with my hands, and so got away altogether.
5230	The last I saw of the chase was a little group of a dozen people
5230	perhaps, studying with infinite perplexity a slowly drying
5230	footprint that had resulted from a puddle in Tavistock Square, a
5230	footprint as isolated and incomprehensible to them as Crusoe's
5230	solitary discovery.
5230	
5230	""This running warmed me to a certain extent, and I went on with a
5230	better courage through the maze of less frequented roads that runs
5230	hereabouts. My back had now become very stiff and sore, my tonsils
5230	were painful from the cabman's fingers, and the skin of my neck
5230	had been scratched by his nails; my feet hurt exceedingly and I
5230	was lame from a little cut on one foot. I saw in time a blind
5230	man approaching me, and fled limping, for I feared his subtle
5230	intuitions. Once or twice accidental collisions occurred and I left
5230	people amazed, with unaccountable curses ringing in their ears.
5230	Then came something silent and quiet against my face, and across
5230	the Square fell a thin veil of slowly falling flakes of snow. I had
5230	caught a cold, and do as I would I could not avoid an occasional
5230	sneeze. And every dog that came in sight, with its pointing nose
5230	and curious sniffing, was a terror to me.
5230	
5230	""Then came men and boys running, first one and then others, and
5230	shouting as they ran. It was a fire. They ran in the direction of
5230	my lodging, and looking back down a street I saw a mass of black
5230	smoke streaming up above the roofs and telephone wires. It was my
5230	lodging burning; my clothes, my apparatus, all my resources indeed,
5230	except my cheque-book and the three volumes of memoranda that
5230	awaited me in Great Portland Street, were there. Burning! I had
5230	burnt my boats--if ever a man did! The place was blazing.""
5230	
5230	The Invisible Man paused and thought. Kemp glanced nervously out of
5230	the window. ""Yes?"" he said. ""Go on.""

5230	
5230	CHAPTER XXII
5230	
5230	IN THE EMPORIUM
5230	
5230	
5230	""So last January, with the beginning of a snowstorm in the air
5230	about me--and if it settled on me it would betray me!--weary,
5230	cold, painful, inexpressibly wretched, and still but half convinced
5230	of my invisible quality, I began this new life to which I am
5230	committed. I had no refuge, no appliances, no human being in the
5230	world in whom I could confide. To have told my secret would have
5230	given me away--made a mere show and rarity of me. Nevertheless, I
5230	was half-minded to accost some passer-by and throw myself upon his
5230	mercy. But I knew too clearly the terror and brutal cruelty my
5230	advances would evoke. I made no plans in the street. My sole object
5230	was to get shelter from the snow, to get myself covered and warm;
5230	then I might hope to plan. But even to me, an Invisible Man, the
5230	rows of London houses stood latched, barred, and bolted
5230	impregnably.
5230	
5230	""Only one thing could I see clearly before me--the cold exposure
5230	and misery of the snowstorm and the night.
5230	
5230	""And then I had a brilliant idea. I turned down one of the roads
5230	leading from Gower Street to Tottenham Court Road, and found myself
5230	outside Omniums, the big establishment where everything is to be
5230	bought--you know the place: meat, grocery, linen, furniture,
5230	clothing, oil paintings even--a huge meandering collection of shops
5230	rather than a shop. I had thought I should find the doors open, but
5230	they were closed, and as I stood in the wide entrance a carriage
5230	stopped outside, and a man in uniform--you know the kind of
5230	personage with 'Omnium' on his cap--flung open the door. I contrived
5230	to enter, and walking down the shop--it was a department where they
5230	were selling ribbons and gloves and stockings and that kind of
5230	thing--came to a more spacious region devoted to picnic baskets and
5230	wicker furniture.
5230	
5230	""I did not feel safe there, however; people were going to and fro,
5230	and I prowled restlessly about until I came upon a huge section in
5230	an upper floor containing multitudes of bedsteads, and over these I
5230	clambered, and found a resting-place at last among a huge pile of
5230	folded flock mattresses. The place was already lit up and agreeably
5230	warm, and I decided to remain where I was, keeping a cautious
5230	eye on the two or three sets of shopmen and customers who were
5230	meandering through the place, until closing time came. Then I
5230	should be able, I thought, to rob the place for food and clothing,
5230	and disguised, prowl through it and examine its resources, perhaps
5230	sleep on some of the bedding. That seemed an acceptable plan.
5230	My idea was to procure clothing to make myself a muffled but
5230	acceptable figure, to get money, and then to recover my books
5230	and parcels where they awaited me, take a lodging somewhere and
5230	elaborate plans for the complete realisation of the advantages my
5230	invisibility gave me (as I still imagined) over my fellow-men.
5230	
5230	""Closing time arrived quickly enough. It could not have been more
5230	than an hour after I took up my position on the mattresses before I
5230	noticed the blinds of the windows being drawn, and customers being
5230	marched doorward. And then a number of brisk young men began with
5230	remarkable alacrity to tidy up the goods that remained disturbed. I
5230	left my lair as the crowds diminished, and prowled cautiously out
5230	into the less desolate parts of the shop. I was really surprised to
5230	observe how rapidly the young men and women whipped away the goods
5230	displayed for sale during the day. All the boxes of goods, the
5230	hanging fabrics, the festoons of lace, the boxes of sweets in the
5230	grocery section, the displays of this and that, were being whipped
5230	down, folded up, slapped into tidy receptacles, and everything that
5230	could not be taken down and put away had sheets of some coarse
5230	stuff like sacking flung over them. Finally all the chairs were
5230	turned up on to the counters, leaving the floor clear. Directly
5230	each of these young people had done, he or she made promptly for
5230	the door with such an expression of animation as I have rarely
5230	observed in a shop assistant before. Then came a lot of youngsters
5230	scattering sawdust and carrying pails and brooms. I had to dodge
5230	to get out of the way, and as it was, my ankle got stung with the
5230	sawdust. For some time, wandering through the swathed and darkened
5230	departments, I could hear the brooms at work. And at last a good
5230	hour or more after the shop had been closed, came a noise of
5230	locking doors. Silence came upon the place, and I found myself
5230	wandering through the vast and intricate shops, galleries, show-rooms
5230	of the place, alone. It was very still; in one place I remember
5230	passing near one of the Tottenham Court Road entrances and listening
5230	to the tapping of boot-heels of the passers-by.
5230	
5230	""My first visit was to the place where I had seen stockings and
5230	gloves for sale. It was dark, and I had the devil of a hunt after
5230	matches, which I found at last in the drawer of the little cash
5230	desk. Then I had to get a candle. I had to tear down wrappings and
5230	ransack a number of boxes and drawers, but at last I managed to turn
5230	out what I sought; the box label called them lambswool pants, and
5230	lambswool vests. Then socks, a thick comforter, and then I went to
5230	the clothing place and got trousers, a lounge jacket, an overcoat
5230	and a slouch hat--a clerical sort of hat with the brim turned down.
5230	I began to feel a human being again, and my next thought was food.
5230	
5230	""Upstairs was a refreshment department, and there I got cold meat.
5230	There was coffee still in the urn, and I lit the gas and warmed it
5230	up again, and altogether I did not do badly. Afterwards, prowling
5230	through the place in search of blankets--I had to put up at last
5230	with a heap of down quilts--I came upon a grocery section with
5230	a lot of chocolate and candied fruits, more than was good for me
5230	indeed--and some white burgundy. And near that was a toy department,
5230	and I had a brilliant idea. I found some artificial noses--dummy
5230	noses, you know, and I thought of dark spectacles. But Omniums had
5230	no optical department. My nose had been a difficulty indeed--I had
5230	thought of paint. But the discovery set my mind running on wigs and
5230	masks and the like. Finally I went to sleep in a heap of down
5230	quilts, very warm and comfortable.
5230	
5230	""My last thoughts before sleeping were the most agreeable I had had
5230	since the change. I was in a state of physical serenity, and that
5230	was reflected in my mind. I thought that I should be able to slip
5230	out unobserved in the morning with my clothes upon me, muffling my
5230	face with a white wrapper I had taken, purchase, with the money I
5230	had taken, spectacles and so forth, and so complete my disguise. I
5230	lapsed into disorderly dreams of all the fantastic things that had
5230	happened during the last few days. I saw the ugly little Jew of a
5230	landlord vociferating in his rooms; I saw his two sons marvelling,
5230	and the wrinkled old woman's gnarled face as she asked for her cat.
5230	I experienced again the strange sensation of seeing the cloth
5230	disappear, and so I came round to the windy hillside and the
5230	sniffing old clergyman mumbling 'Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
5230	dust to dust,' at my father's open grave.
5230	
5230	""'You also,' said a voice, and suddenly I was being forced towards
5230	the grave. I struggled, shouted, appealed to the mourners, but they
5230	continued stonily following the service; the old clergyman, too,
5230	never faltered droning and sniffing through the ritual. I realised
5230	I was invisible and inaudible, that overwhelming forces had their
5230	grip on me. I struggled in vain, I was forced over the brink, the
5230	coffin rang hollow as I fell upon it, and the gravel came flying
5230	after me in spadefuls. Nobody heeded me, nobody was aware of me. I
5230	made convulsive struggles and awoke.
5230	
5230	""The pale London dawn had come, the place was full of a chilly grey
5230	light that filtered round the edges of the window blinds. I sat up,
5230	and for a time I could not think where this ample apartment, with
5230	its counters, its piles of rolled stuff, its heap of quilts and
5230	cushions, its iron pillars, might be. Then, as recollection came
5230	back to me, I heard voices in conversation.
5230	
5230	""Then far down the place, in the brighter light of some department
5230	which had already raised its blinds, I saw two men approaching. I
5230	scrambled to my feet, looking about me for some way of escape, and
5230	even as I did so the sound of my movement made them aware of me. I
5230	suppose they saw merely a figure moving quietly and quickly away.
5230	'Who's that?' cried one, and 'Stop there!' shouted the other. I
5230	dashed around a corner and came full tilt--a faceless figure,
5230	mind you!--on a lanky lad of fifteen. He yelled and I bowled him
5230	over, rushed past him, turned another corner, and by a happy
5230	inspiration threw myself behind a counter. In another moment feet
5230	went running past and I heard voices shouting, 'All hands to the
5230	doors!' asking what was 'up,' and giving one another advice how to
5230	catch me.
5230	
5230	""Lying on the ground, I felt scared out of my wits. But--odd as
5230	it may seem--it did not occur to me at the moment to take off my
5230	clothes as I should have done. I had made up my mind, I suppose, to
5230	get away in them, and that ruled me. And then down the vista of the
5230	counters came a bawling of 'Here he is!'
5230	
5230	""I sprang to my feet, whipped a chair off the counter, and sent it
5230	whirling at the fool who had shouted, turned, came into another
5230	round a corner, sent him spinning, and rushed up the stairs. He
5230	kept his footing, gave a view hallo, and came up the staircase hot
5230	after me. Up the staircase were piled a multitude of those
5230	bright-coloured pot things--what are they?""
5230	
5230	""Art pots,"" suggested Kemp.
5230	
5230	""That's it! Art pots. Well, I turned at the top step and swung
5230	round, plucked one out of a pile and smashed it on his silly head
5230	as he came at me. The whole pile of pots went headlong, and I heard
5230	shouting and footsteps running from all parts. I made a mad rush
5230	for the refreshment place, and there was a man in white like a man
5230	cook, who took up the chase. I made one last desperate turn and
5230	found myself among lamps and ironmongery. I went behind the counter
5230	of this, and waited for my cook, and as he bolted in at the head of
5230	the chase, I doubled him up with a lamp. Down he went, and I
5230	crouched down behind the counter and began whipping off my clothes
5230	as fast as I could. Coat, jacket, trousers, shoes were all right,
5230	but a lambswool vest fits a man like a skin. I heard more men
5230	coming, my cook was lying quiet on the other side of the counter,
5230	stunned or scared speechless, and I had to make another dash for
5230	it, like a rabbit hunted out of a wood-pile.
5230	
5230	""'This way, policeman!' I heard someone shouting. I found myself in
5230	my bedstead storeroom again, and at the end of a wilderness of
5230	wardrobes. I rushed among them, went flat, got rid of my vest after
5230	infinite wriggling, and stood a free man again, panting and scared,
5230	as the policeman and three of the shopmen came round the corner.
5230	They made a rush for the vest and pants, and collared the trousers.
5230	'He's dropping his plunder,' said one of the young men. 'He _must_
5230	be somewhere here.'
5230	
5230	""But they did not find me all the same.
5230	
5230	""I stood watching them hunt for me for a time, and cursing my
5230	ill-luck in losing the clothes. Then I went into the refreshment-room,
5230	drank a little milk I found there, and sat down by the fire to
5230	consider my position.
5230	
5230	""In a little while two assistants came in and began to talk over
5230	the business very excitedly and like the fools they were. I heard a
5230	magnified account of my depredations, and other speculations as to
5230	my whereabouts. Then I fell to scheming again. The insurmountable
5230	difficulty of the place, especially now it was alarmed, was to get
5230	any plunder out of it. I went down into the warehouse to see if
5230	there was any chance of packing and addressing a parcel, but I
5230	could not understand the system of checking. About eleven o'clock,
5230	the snow having thawed as it fell, and the day being finer and a
5230	little warmer than the previous one, I decided that the Emporium
5230	was hopeless, and went out again, exasperated at my want of
5230	success, with only the vaguest plans of action in my mind.""
5230	
5230	
5230	
5230	CHAPTER XXIII
5230	
5230	IN DRURY LANE
5230	
5230	
5230	""But you begin now to realise,"" said the Invisible Man, ""the full
5230	disadvantage of my condition. I had no shelter--no covering--to
5230	get clothing was to forego all my advantage, to make myself a
5230	strange and terrible thing. I was fasting; for to eat, to fill
5230	myself with unassimilated matter, would be to become grotesquely
5230	visible again.""
5230	
5230	""I never thought of that,"" said Kemp.
5230	
5230	""Nor had I. And the snow had warned me of other dangers. I could not
5230	go abroad in snow--it would settle on me and expose me. Rain, too,
5230	would make me a watery outline, a glistening surface of a man--a
5230	bubble. And fog--I should be like a fainter bubble in a fog,
5230	a surface, a greasy glimmer of humanity. Moreover, as I went
5230	abroad--in the London air--I gathered dirt about my ankles, floating
5230	smuts and dust upon my skin. I did not know how long it would be
5230	before I should become visible from that cause also. But I saw
5230	clearly it could not be for long.
5230	
5230	""Not in London at any rate.
5230	
5230	""I went into the slums towards Great Portland Street, and found
5230	myself at the end of the street in which I had lodged. I did not
5230	go that way, because of the crowd halfway down it opposite to the
5230	still smoking ruins of the house I had fired. My most immediate
5230	problem was to get clothing. What to do with my face puzzled me.
5230	Then I saw in one of those little miscellaneous shops--news,
5230	sweets, toys, stationery, belated Christmas tomfoolery, and so
5230	forth--an array of masks and noses. I realised that problem was
5230	solved. In a flash I saw my course. I turned about, no longer
5230	aimless, and went--circuitously in order to avoid the busy ways,
5230	towards the back streets north of the Strand; for I remembered,
5230	though not very distinctly where, that some theatrical costumiers
5230	had shops in that district.
5230	
5230	""The day was cold, with a nipping wind down the northward running
5230	streets. I walked fast to avoid being overtaken. Every crossing was
5230	a danger, every passenger a thing to watch alertly. One man as I
5230	was about to pass him at the top of Bedford Street, turned upon
5230	me abruptly and came into me, sending me into the road and almost
5230	under the wheel of a passing hansom. The verdict of the cab-rank
5230	was that he had had some sort of stroke. I was so unnerved by this
5230	encounter that I went into Covent Garden Market and sat down for
5230	some time in a quiet corner by a stall of violets, panting and
5230	trembling. I found I had caught a fresh cold, and had to turn out
5230	after a time lest my sneezes should attract attention.
5230	
5230	""At last I reached the object of my quest, a dirty, fly-blown little
5230	shop in a by-way near Drury Lane, with a window full of tinsel
5230	robes, sham jewels, wigs, slippers, dominoes and theatrical
5230	photographs. The shop was old-fashioned and low and dark, and the
5230	house rose above it for four storeys, dark and dismal. I peered
5230	through the window and, seeing no one within, entered. The opening
5230	of the door set a clanking bell ringing. I left it open, and walked
5230	round a bare costume stand, into a corner behind a cheval glass. For
5230	a minute or so no one came. Then I heard heavy feet striding across
5230	a room, and a man appeared down the shop.
5230	
5230	""My plans were now perfectly definite. I proposed to make my way
5230	into the house, secrete myself upstairs, watch my opportunity, and
5230	when everything was quiet, rummage out a wig, mask, spectacles, and
5230	costume, and go into the world, perhaps a grotesque but still a
5230	credible figure. And incidentally of course I could rob the house
5230	of any available money.
5230	
5230	""The man who had just entered the shop was a short, slight,
5230	hunched, beetle-browed man, with long arms and very short bandy
5230	legs. Apparently I had interrupted a meal. He stared about the shop
5230	with an expression of expectation. This gave way to surprise, and
5230	then to anger, as he saw the shop empty. 'Damn the boys!' he said.
5230	He went to stare up and down the street. He came in again in a
5230	minute, kicked the door to with his foot spitefully, and went
5230	muttering back to the house door.
5230	
5230	""I came forward to follow him, and at the noise of my movement he
5230	stopped dead. I did so too, startled by his quickness of ear. He
5230	slammed the house door in my face.
5230	
5230	""I stood hesitating. Suddenly I heard his quick footsteps returning,
5230	and the door reopened. He stood looking about the shop like one who
5230	was still not satisfied. Then, murmuring to himself, he examined the
5230	back of the counter and peered behind some fixtures. Then he stood
5230	doubtful. He had left the house door open and I slipped into the
5230	inner room.
5230	
5230	""It was a queer little room, poorly furnished and with a number of
5230	big masks in the corner. On the table was his belated breakfast,
5230	and it was a confoundedly exasperating thing for me, Kemp, to have
5230	to sniff his coffee and stand watching while he came in and resumed
5230	his meal. And his table manners were irritating. Three doors opened
5230	into the little room, one going upstairs and one down, but they
5230	were all shut. I could not get out of the room while he was there;
5230	I could scarcely move because of his alertness, and there was a
5230	draught down my back. Twice I strangled a sneeze just in time.
5230	
5230	""The spectacular quality of my sensations was curious and novel, but
5230	for all that I was heartily tired and angry long before he had done
5230	his eating. But at last he made an end and putting his beggarly
5230	crockery on the black tin tray upon which he had had his teapot, and
5230	gathering all the crumbs up on the mustard stained cloth, he took
5230	the whole lot of things after him. His burden prevented his shutting
5230	the door behind him--as he would have done; I never saw such a man
5230	for shutting doors--and I followed him into a very dirty underground
5230	kitchen and scullery. I had the pleasure of seeing him begin to wash
5230	up, and then, finding no good in keeping down there, and the brick
5230	floor being cold on my feet, I returned upstairs and sat in his
5230	chair by the fire. It was burning low, and scarcely thinking, I put
5230	on a little coal. The noise of this brought him up at once, and
5230	he stood aglare. He peered about the room and was within an ace
5230	of touching me. Even after that examination, he scarcely seemed
5230	satisfied. He stopped in the doorway and took a final inspection
5230	before he went down.
5230	
5230	""I waited in the little parlour for an age, and at last he came up
5230	and opened the upstairs door. I just managed to get by him.
5230	
5230	""On the staircase he stopped suddenly, so that I very nearly
5230	blundered into him. He stood looking back right into my face and
5230	listening. 'I could have sworn,' he said. His long hairy hand
5230	pulled at his lower lip. His eye went up and down the staircase.
5230	Then he grunted and went on up again.
5230	
5230	""His hand was on the handle of a door, and then he stopped again
5230	with the same puzzled anger on his face. He was becoming aware of
5230	the faint sounds of my movements about him. The man must have had
5230	diabolically acute hearing. He suddenly flashed into rage. 'If
5230	there's anyone in this house--' he cried with an oath, and left the
5230	threat unfinished. He put his hand in his pocket, failed to find
5230	what he wanted, and rushing past me went blundering noisily and
5230	pugnaciously downstairs. But I did not follow him. I sat on the
5230	head of the staircase until his return.
5230	
5230	""Presently he came up again, still muttering. He opened the door of
5230	the room, and before I could enter, slammed it in my face.
5230	
5230	""I resolved to explore the house, and spent some time in doing so
5230	as noiselessly as possible. The house was very old and tumble-down,
5230	damp so that the paper in the attics was peeling from the walls, and
5230	rat infested. Some of the door handles were stiff and I was afraid
5230	to turn them. Several rooms I did inspect were unfurnished, and
5230	others were littered with theatrical lumber, bought second-hand, I
5230	judged, from its appearance. In one room next to his I found a lot
5230	of old clothes. I began routing among these, and in my eagerness
5230	forgot again the evident sharpness of his ears. I heard a stealthy
5230	footstep and, looking up just in time, saw him peering in at the
5230	tumbled heap and holding an old-fashioned revolver in his hand.
5230	I stood perfectly still while he stared about open-mouthed and
5230	suspicious. 'It must have been her,' he said slowly. 'Damn her!'
5230	
5230	""He shut the door quietly, and immediately I heard the key turn in
5230	the lock. Then his footsteps retreated. I realised abruptly that I
5230	was locked in. For a minute I did not know what to do. I walked
5230	from door to window and back, and stood perplexed. A gust of anger
5230	came upon me. But I decided to inspect the clothes before I did
5230	anything further, and my first attempt brought down a pile from an
5230	upper shelf. This brought him back, more sinister than ever. That
5230	time he actually touched me, jumped back with amazement and stood
5230	astonished in the middle of the room.
5230	
5230	""Presently he calmed a little. 'Rats,' he said in an undertone,
5230	fingers on lips. He was evidently a little scared. I edged quietly
5230	out of the room, but a plank creaked. Then the infernal little brute
5230	started going all over the house, revolver in hand and locking door
5230	after door and pocketing the keys. When I realised what he was up to
5230	I had a fit of rage--I could hardly control myself sufficiently to
5230	watch my opportunity. By this time I knew he was alone in the house,
5230	and so I made no more ado, but knocked him on the head.""
5230	
5230	""Knocked him on the head?"" exclaimed Kemp.
5230	
5230	""Yes--stunned him--as he was going downstairs. Hit him from
5230	behind with a stool that stood on the landing. He went downstairs
5230	like a bag of old boots.""
5230	
5230	""But--I say! The common conventions of humanity--""
5230	
5230	""Are all very well for common people. But the point was, Kemp, that
5230	I had to get out of that house in a disguise without his seeing me.
5230	I couldn't think of any other way of doing it. And then I gagged
5230	him with a Louis Quatorze vest and tied him up in a sheet.""
5230	
5230	""Tied him up in a sheet!""
5230	
5230	""Made a sort of bag of it. It was rather a good idea to keep the
5230	idiot scared and quiet, and a devilish hard thing to get out
5230	of--head away from the string. My dear Kemp, it's no good your
5230	sitting glaring as though I was a murderer. It had to be done. He
5230	had his revolver. If once he saw me he would be able to describe
5230	me--""
5230	
5230	""But still,"" said Kemp, ""in England--to-day. And the man was in
5230	his own house, and you were--well, robbing.""
5230	
5230	""Robbing! Confound it! You'll call me a thief next! Surely, Kemp,
5230	you're not fool enough to dance on the old strings. Can't you see
5230	my position?""
5230	
5230	""And his too,"" said Kemp.
5230	
5230	The Invisible Man stood up sharply. ""What do you mean to say?""
5230	
5230	Kemp's face grew a trifle hard. He was about to speak and checked
5230	himself. ""I suppose, after all,"" he said with a sudden change of
5230	manner, ""the thing had to be done. You were in a fix. But still--""
5230	
5230	""Of course I was in a fix--an infernal fix. And he made me wild
5230	too--hunting me about the house, fooling about with his revolver,
5230	locking and unlocking doors. He was simply exasperating. You don't
5230	blame me, do you? You don't blame me?""
5230	
5230	""I never blame anyone,"" said Kemp. ""It's quite out of fashion. What
5230	did you do next?""
5230	
5230	""I was hungry. Downstairs I found a loaf and some rank cheese--more
5230	than sufficient to satisfy my hunger. I took some brandy and
5230	water, and then went up past my impromptu bag--he was lying quite
5230	still--to the room containing the old clothes. This looked out
5230	upon the street, two lace curtains brown with dirt guarding the
5230	window. I went and peered out through their interstices. Outside
5230	the day was bright--by contrast with the brown shadows of the
5230	dismal house in which I found myself, dazzlingly bright. A brisk
5230	traffic was going by, fruit carts, a hansom, a four-wheeler with a
5230	pile of boxes, a fishmonger's cart. I turned with spots of colour
5230	swimming before my eyes to the shadowy fixtures behind me. My
5230	excitement was giving place to a clear apprehension of my position
5230	again. The room was full of a faint scent of benzoline, used, I
5230	suppose, in cleaning the garments.
5230	
5230	""I began a systematic search of the place. I should judge the
5230	hunchback had been alone in the house for some time. He was a
5230	curious person. Everything that could possibly be of service to me
5230	I collected in the clothes storeroom, and then I made a deliberate
5230	selection. I found a handbag I thought a suitable possession, and
5230	some powder, rouge, and sticking-plaster.
5230	
5230	""I had thought of painting and powdering my face and all that
5230	there was to show of me, in order to render myself visible, but
5230	the disadvantage of this lay in the fact that I should require
5230	turpentine and other appliances and a considerable amount of time
5230	before I could vanish again. Finally I chose a mask of the better
5230	type, slightly grotesque but not more so than many human beings,
5230	dark glasses, greyish whiskers, and a wig. I could find no
5230	underclothing, but that I could buy subsequently, and for the time I
5230	swathed myself in calico dominoes and some white cashmere scarfs. I
5230	could find no socks, but the hunchback's boots were rather a loose
5230	fit and sufficed. In a desk in the shop were three sovereigns and
5230	about thirty shillings' worth of silver, and in a locked cupboard I
5230	burst in the inner room were eight pounds in gold. I could go forth
5230	into the world again, equipped.
5230	
5230	""Then came a curious hesitation. Was my appearance really
5230	credible? I tried myself with a little bedroom looking-glass,
5230	inspecting myself from every point of view to discover any
5230	forgotten chink, but it all seemed sound. I was grotesque to the
5230	theatrical pitch, a stage miser, but I was certainly not a physical
5230	impossibility. Gathering confidence, I took my looking-glass down
5230	into the shop, pulled down the shop blinds, and surveyed myself
5230	from every point of view with the help of the cheval glass in the
5230	corner.
5230	
5230	""I spent some minutes screwing up my courage and then unlocked the
5230	shop door and marched out into the street, leaving the little man
5230	to get out of his sheet again when he liked. In five minutes a
5230	dozen turnings intervened between me and the costumier's shop. No
5230	one appeared to notice me very pointedly. My last difficulty seemed
5230	overcome.""
5230	
5230	He stopped again.
5230	
5230	""And you troubled no more about the hunchback?"" said Kemp.
5230	
5230	""No,"" said the Invisible Man. ""Nor have I heard what became of him.
5230	I suppose he untied himself or kicked himself out. The knots were
5230	pretty tight.""
5230	
5230	He became silent and went to the window and stared out.
5230	
5230	""What happened when you went out into the Strand?""
5230	
5230	""Oh!--disillusionment again. I thought my troubles were over.
5230	Practically I thought I had impunity to do whatever I chose,
5230	everything--save to give away my secret. So I thought. Whatever I
5230	did, whatever the consequences might be, was nothing to me. I had
5230	merely to fling aside my garments and vanish. No person could hold
5230	me. I could take my money where I found it. I decided to treat
5230	myself to a sumptuous feast, and then put up at a good hotel, and
5230	accumulate a new outfit of property. I felt amazingly confident;
5230	it's not particularly pleasant recalling that I was an ass. I went
5230	into a place and was already ordering lunch, when it occurred to me
5230	that I could not eat unless I exposed my invisible face. I finished
5230	ordering the lunch, told the man I should be back in ten minutes,
5230	and went out exasperated. I don't know if you have ever been
5230	disappointed in your appetite.""
5230	
5230	""Not quite so badly,"" said Kemp, ""but I can imagine it.""
5230	
5230	""I could have smashed the silly devils. At last, faint with the
5230	desire for tasteful food, I went into another place and demanded a
5230	private room. 'I am disfigured,' I said. 'Badly.' They looked at
5230	me curiously, but of course it was not their affair--and so at
5230	last I got my lunch. It was not particularly well served, but it
5230	sufficed; and when I had had it, I sat over a cigar, trying to plan
5230	my line of action. And outside a snowstorm was beginning.
5230	
5230	""The more I thought it over, Kemp, the more I realised what a
5230	helpless absurdity an Invisible Man was--in a cold and dirty
5230	climate and a crowded civilised city. Before I made this mad
5230	experiment I had dreamt of a thousand advantages. That afternoon
5230	it seemed all disappointment. I went over the heads of the things
5230	a man reckons desirable. No doubt invisibility made it possible
5230	to get them, but it made it impossible to enjoy them when they
5230	are got. Ambition--what is the good of pride of place when you
5230	cannot appear there? What is the good of the love of woman when
5230	her name must needs be Delilah? I have no taste for politics, for
5230	the blackguardisms of fame, for philanthropy, for sport. What was
5230	I to do? And for this I had become a wrapped-up mystery, a swathed
5230	and bandaged caricature of a man!""
5230	
5230	He paused, and his attitude suggested a roving glance at the
5230	window.
5230	
5230	""But how did you get to Iping?"" said Kemp, anxious to keep his
5230	guest busy talking.
5230	
5230	""I went there to work. I had one hope. It was a half idea! I have
5230	it still. It is a full blown idea now. A way of getting back! Of
5230	restoring what I have done. When I choose. When I have done all I
5230	mean to do invisibly. And that is what I chiefly want to talk to
5230	you about now.""
5230	
5230	""You went straight to Iping?""
5230	
5230	""Yes. I had simply to get my three volumes of memoranda and my
5230	cheque-book, my luggage and underclothing, order a quantity of
5230	chemicals to work out this idea of mine--I will show you the
5230	calculations as soon as I get my books--and then I started. Jove!
5230	I remember the snowstorm now, and the accursed bother it was to
5230	keep the snow from damping my pasteboard nose.""
5230	
5230	""At the end,"" said Kemp, ""the day before yesterday, when they found
5230	you out, you rather--to judge by the papers--""
5230	
5230	""I did. Rather. Did I kill that fool of a constable?""
5230	
5230	""No,"" said Kemp. ""He's expected to recover.""
5230	
5230	""That's his luck, then. I clean lost my temper, the fools! Why
5230	couldn't they leave me alone? And that grocer lout?""
5230	
5230	""There are no deaths expected,"" said Kemp.
5230	
5230	""I don't know about that tramp of mine,"" said the Invisible Man,
5230	with an unpleasant laugh.
5230	
5230	""By Heaven, Kemp, you don't know what rage _is_! ... To have worked
5230	for years, to have planned and plotted, and then to get some
5230	fumbling purblind idiot messing across your course! ... Every
5230	conceivable sort of silly creature that has ever been created has
5230	been sent to cross me.
5230	
5230	""If I have much more of it, I shall go wild--I shall start
5230	mowing 'em.
5230	
5230	""As it is, they've made things a thousand times more difficult.""
5230	
5230	""No doubt it's exasperating,"" said Kemp, drily.
5230	
5230	
5230	
5230	CHAPTER XXIV
5230	
5230	THE PLAN THAT FAILED
5230	
5230	
5230	""But now,"" said Kemp, with a side glance out of the window, ""what
5230	are we to do?""
5230	
5230	He moved nearer his guest as he spoke in such a manner as to
5230	prevent the possibility of a sudden glimpse of the three men who
5230	were advancing up the hill road--with an intolerable slowness, as
5230	it seemed to Kemp.
5230	
5230	""What were you planning to do when you were heading for Port
5230	Burdock? _Had_ you any plan?""
5230	
5230	""I was going to clear out of the country. But I have altered that
5230	plan rather since seeing you. I thought it would be wise, now the
5230	weather is hot and invisibility possible, to make for the South.
5230	Especially as my secret was known, and everyone would be on the
5230	lookout for a masked and muffled man. You have a line of steamers
5230	from here to France. My idea was to get aboard one and run the
5230	risks of the passage. Thence I could go by train into Spain, or else
5230	get to Algiers. It would not be difficult. There a man might always
5230	be invisible--and yet live. And do things. I was using that tramp
5230	as a money box and luggage carrier, until I decided how to get my
5230	books and things sent over to meet me.""
5230	
5230	""That's clear.""
5230	
5230	""And then the filthy brute must needs try and rob me! He _has_ hidden
5230	my books, Kemp. Hidden my books! If I can lay my hands on him!""
5230	
5230	""Best plan to get the books out of him first.""
5230	
5230	""But where is he? Do you know?""
5230	
5230	""He's in the town police station, locked up, by his own request, in
5230	the strongest cell in the place.""
5230	
5230	""Cur!"" said the Invisible Man.
5230	
5230	""But that hangs up your plans a little.""
5230	
5230	""We must get those books; those books are vital.""
5230	
5230	""Certainly,"" said Kemp, a little nervously, wondering if he heard
5230	footsteps outside. ""Certainly we must get those books. But that
5230	won't be difficult, if he doesn't know they're for you.""
5230	
5230	""No,"" said the Invisible Man, and thought.
5230	
5230	Kemp tried to think of something to keep the talk going, but the
5230	Invisible Man resumed of his own accord.
5230	
5230	""Blundering into your house, Kemp,"" he said, ""changes all my plans.
5230	For you are a man that can understand. In spite of all that has
5230	happened, in spite of this publicity, of the loss of my books, of
5230	what I have suffered, there still remain great possibilities, huge
5230	possibilities--""
5230	
5230	""You have told no one I am here?"" he asked abruptly.
5230	
5230	Kemp hesitated. ""That was implied,"" he said.
5230	
5230	""No one?"" insisted Griffin.
5230	
5230	""Not a soul.""
5230	
5230	""Ah! Now--"" The Invisible Man stood up, and sticking his arms akimbo
5230	began to pace the study.
5230	
5230	""I made a mistake, Kemp, a huge mistake, in carrying this thing
5230	through alone. I have wasted strength, time, opportunities. Alone--it
5230	is wonderful how little a man can do alone! To rob a little,
5230	to hurt a little, and there is the end.
5230	
5230	""What I want, Kemp, is a goal-keeper, a helper, and a hiding-place,
5230	an arrangement whereby I can sleep and eat and rest in peace, and
5230	unsuspected. I must have a confederate. With a confederate, with
5230	food and rest--a thousand things are possible.
5230	
5230	""Hitherto I have gone on vague lines. We have to consider all that
5230	invisibility means, all that it does not mean. It means little
5230	advantage for eavesdropping and so forth--one makes sounds. It's
5230	of little help--a little help perhaps--in housebreaking and so
5230	forth. Once you've caught me you could easily imprison me. But on
5230	the other hand I am hard to catch. This invisibility, in fact, is
5230	only good in two cases: It's useful in getting away, it's useful in
5230	approaching. It's particularly useful, therefore, in killing. I can
5230	walk round a man, whatever weapon he has, choose my point, strike
5230	as I like. Dodge as I like. Escape as I like.""
5230	
5230	Kemp's hand went to his moustache. Was that a movement
5230	downstairs?
5230	
5230	""And it is killing we must do, Kemp.""
5230	
5230	""It is killing we must do,"" repeated Kemp. ""I'm listening to your
5230	plan, Griffin, but I'm not agreeing, mind. _Why_ killing?""
5230	
5230	""Not wanton killing, but a judicious slaying. The point is, they
5230	know there is an Invisible Man--as well as we know there is an
5230	Invisible Man. And that Invisible Man, Kemp, must now establish a
5230	Reign of Terror. Yes; no doubt it's startling. But I mean it. A
5230	Reign of Terror. He must take some town like your Burdock and
5230	terrify and dominate it. He must issue his orders. He can do that
5230	in a thousand ways--scraps of paper thrust under doors would
5230	suffice. And all who disobey his orders he must kill, and kill
5230	all who would defend them.""
5230	
5230	""Humph!"" said Kemp, no longer listening to Griffin but to the sound
5230	of his front door opening and closing.
5230	
5230	""It seems to me, Griffin,"" he said, to cover his wandering
5230	attention, ""that your confederate would be in a difficult
5230	position.""
5230	
5230	""No one would know he was a confederate,"" said the Invisible Man,
5230	eagerly. And then suddenly, ""Hush! What's that downstairs?""
5230	
5230	""Nothing,"" said Kemp, and suddenly began to speak loud and fast.
5230	""I don't agree to this, Griffin,"" he said. ""Understand me, I don't
5230	agree to this. Why dream of playing a game against the race? How
5230	can you hope to gain happiness? Don't be a lone wolf. Publish
5230	your results; take the world--take the nation at least--into your
5230	confidence. Think what you might do with a million helpers--""
5230	
5230	The Invisible Man interrupted--arm extended. ""There are
5230	footsteps coming upstairs,"" he said in a low voice.
5230	
5230	""Nonsense,"" said Kemp.
5230	
5230	""Let me see,"" said the Invisible Man, and advanced, arm extended,
5230	to the door.
5230	
5230	And then things happened very swiftly. Kemp hesitated for a second
5230	and then moved to intercept him. The Invisible Man started and stood
5230	still. ""Traitor!"" cried the Voice, and suddenly the dressing-gown
5230	opened, and sitting down the Unseen began to disrobe. Kemp made
5230	three swift steps to the door, and forthwith the Invisible Man--his
5230	legs had vanished--sprang to his feet with a shout. Kemp flung the
5230	door open.
5230	
5230	As it opened, there came a sound of hurrying feet downstairs and
5230	voices.
5230	
5230	With a quick movement Kemp thrust the Invisible Man back, sprang
5230	aside, and slammed the door. The key was outside and ready. In
5230	another moment Griffin would have been alone in the belvedere
5230	study, a prisoner. Save for one little thing. The key had been
5230	slipped in hastily that morning. As Kemp slammed the door it fell
5230	noisily upon the carpet.
5230	
5230	Kemp's face became white. He tried to grip the door handle with
5230	both hands. For a moment he stood lugging. Then the door gave six
5230	inches. But he got it closed again. The second time it was jerked a
5230	foot wide, and the dressing-gown came wedging itself into the
5230	opening. His throat was gripped by invisible fingers, and he left
5230	his hold on the handle to defend himself. He was forced back,
5230	tripped and pitched heavily into the corner of the landing. The
5230	empty dressing-gown was flung on the top of him.
5230	
5230	Halfway up the staircase was Colonel Adye, the recipient of Kemp's
5230	letter, the chief of the Burdock police. He was staring aghast at
5230	the sudden appearance of Kemp, followed by the extraordinary sight
5230	of clothing tossing empty in the air. He saw Kemp felled, and
5230	struggling to his feet. He saw him rush forward, and go down again,
5230	felled like an ox.
5230	
5230	Then suddenly he was struck violently. By nothing! A vast weight,
5230	it seemed, leapt upon him, and he was hurled headlong down the
5230	staircase, with a grip on his throat and a knee in his groin. An
5230	invisible foot trod on his back, a ghostly patter passed downstairs,
5230	he heard the two police officers in the hall shout and run, and the
5230	front door of the house slammed violently.
5230	
5230	He rolled over and sat up staring. He saw, staggering down the
5230	staircase, Kemp, dusty and disheveled, one side of his face white
5230	from a blow, his lip bleeding, and a pink dressing-gown and some
5230	underclothing held in his arms.
5230	
5230	""My God!"" cried Kemp, ""the game's up! He's gone!""
5230

5230	
5230	THE HUNTING OF THE INVISIBLE MAN
5230	
5230	
5230	For a space Kemp was too inarticulate to make Adye understand the
5230	swift things that had just happened. They stood on the landing,
5230	Kemp speaking swiftly, the grotesque swathings of Griffin still on
5230	his arm. But presently Adye began to grasp something of the
5230	situation.
5230	
5230	""He is mad,"" said Kemp; ""inhuman. He is pure selfishness. He thinks
5230	of nothing but his own advantage, his own safety. I have listened
5230	to such a story this morning of brutal self-seeking.... He has wounded
5230	men. He will kill them unless we can prevent him. He will create a
5230	panic. Nothing can stop him. He is going out now--furious!""
5230	
5230	""He must be caught,"" said Adye. ""That is certain.""
5230	
5230	""But how?"" cried Kemp, and suddenly became full of ideas. ""You must
5230	begin at once. You must set every available man to work; you must
5230	prevent his leaving this district. Once he gets away, he may go
5230	through the countryside as he wills, killing and maiming. He dreams
5230	of a reign of terror! A reign of terror, I tell you. You must set a
5230	watch on trains and roads and shipping. The garrison must help. You
5230	must wire for help. The only thing that may keep him here is the
5230	thought of recovering some books of notes he counts of value. I will
5230	tell you of that! There is a man in your police station--Marvel.""
5230	
5230	""I know,"" said Adye, ""I know. Those books--yes. But the tramp....""
5230	
5230	""Says he hasn't them. But he thinks the tramp has. And you must
5230	prevent him from eating or sleeping; day and night the country must
5230	be astir for him. Food must be locked up and secured, all food, so
5230	that he will have to break his way to it. The houses everywhere must
5230	be barred against him. Heaven send us cold nights and rain! The
5230	whole country-side must begin hunting and keep hunting. I tell you,
5230	Adye, he is a danger, a disaster; unless he is pinned and secured,
5230	it is frightful to think of the things that may happen.""
5230	
5230	""What else can we do?"" said Adye. ""I must go down at once and begin
5230	organising. But why not come? Yes--you come too! Come, and we
5230	must hold a sort of council of war--get Hopps to help--and the
5230	railway managers. By Jove! it's urgent. Come along--tell me as we
5230	go. What else is there we can do? Put that stuff down.""
5230	
5230	In another moment Adye was leading the way downstairs. They found
5230	the front door open and the policemen standing outside staring at
5230	empty air. ""He's got away, sir,"" said one.
5230	
5230	""We must go to the central station at once,"" said Adye. ""One of you
5230	go on down and get a cab to come up and meet us--quickly. And
5230	now, Kemp, what else?""
5230	
5230	""Dogs,"" said Kemp. ""Get dogs. They don't see him, but they wind
5230	him. Get dogs.""
5230	
5230	""Good,"" said Adye. ""It's not generally known, but the prison
5230	officials over at Halstead know a man with bloodhounds. Dogs. What
5230	else?""
5230	
5230	""Bear in mind,"" said Kemp, ""his food shows. After eating, his food
5230	shows until it is assimilated. So that he has to hide after eating.
5230	You must keep on beating. Every thicket, every quiet corner. And
5230	put all weapons--all implements that might be weapons, away. He
5230	can't carry such things for long. And what he can snatch up and
5230	strike men with must be hidden away.""
5230	
5230	""Good again,"" said Adye. ""We shall have him yet!""
5230	
5230	""And on the roads,"" said Kemp, and hesitated.
5230	
5230	""Yes?"" said Adye.
5230	
5230	""Powdered glass,"" said Kemp. ""It's cruel, I know. But think of what
5230	he may do!""
5230	
5230	Adye drew the air in sharply between his teeth. ""It's
5230	unsportsmanlike. I don't know. But I'll have powdered glass got
5230	ready. If he goes too far....""
5230	
5230	""The man's become inhuman, I tell you,"" said Kemp. ""I am as sure he
5230	will establish a reign of terror--so soon as he has got over the
5230	emotions of this escape--as I am sure I am talking to you. Our
5230	only chance is to be ahead. He has cut himself off from his kind.
5230	His blood be upon his own head.""

5230	
5230	CHAPTER XXVI
5230	
5230	THE WICKSTEED MURDER
5230	
5230	
5230	The Invisible Man seems to have rushed out of Kemp's house in a
5230	state of blind fury. A little child playing near Kemp's gateway was
5230	violently caught up and thrown aside, so that its ankle was broken,
5230	and thereafter for some hours the Invisible Man passed out of human
5230	perceptions. No one knows where he went nor what he did. But one
5230	can imagine him hurrying through the hot June forenoon, up the
5230	hill and on to the open downland behind Port Burdock, raging and
5230	despairing at his intolerable fate, and sheltering at last, heated
5230	and weary, amid the thickets of Hintondean, to piece together again
5230	his shattered schemes against his species. That seems the most
5230	probable refuge for him, for there it was he re-asserted himself in
5230	a grimly tragical manner about two in the afternoon.
5230	
5230	One wonders what his state of mind may have been during that time,
5230	and what plans he devised. No doubt he was almost ecstatically
5230	exasperated by Kemp's treachery, and though we may be able to
5230	understand the motives that led to that deceit, we may still
5230	imagine and even sympathise a little with the fury the attempted
5230	surprise must have occasioned. Perhaps something of the stunned
5230	astonishment of his Oxford Street experiences may have returned to
5230	him, for he had evidently counted on Kemp's co-operation in his
5230	brutal dream of a terrorised world. At any rate he vanished from
5230	human ken about midday, and no living witness can tell what he did
5230	until about half-past two. It was a fortunate thing, perhaps, for
5230	humanity, but for him it was a fatal inaction.
5230	
5230	During that time a growing multitude of men scattered over the
5230	countryside were busy. In the morning he had still been simply a
5230	legend, a terror; in the afternoon, by virtue chiefly of Kemp's
5230	drily worded proclamation, he was presented as a tangible
5230	antagonist, to be wounded, captured, or overcome, and the
5230	countryside began organising itself with inconceivable rapidity.
5230	By two o'clock even he might still have removed himself out of
5230	the district by getting aboard a train, but after two that became
5230	impossible. Every passenger train along the lines on a great
5230	parallelogram between Southampton, Manchester, Brighton and Horsham,
5230	travelled with locked doors, and the goods traffic was almost
5230	entirely suspended. And in a great circle of twenty miles round Port
5230	Burdock, men armed with guns and bludgeons were presently setting
5230	out in groups of three and four, with dogs, to beat the roads and
5230	fields.
5230	
5230	Mounted policemen rode along the country lanes, stopping at every
5230	cottage and warning the people to lock up their houses, and keep
5230	indoors unless they were armed, and all the elementary schools had
5230	broken up by three o'clock, and the children, scared and keeping
5230	together in groups, were hurrying home. Kemp's proclamation--signed
5230	indeed by Adye--was posted over almost the whole district by four or
5230	five o'clock in the afternoon. It gave briefly but clearly all the
5230	conditions of the struggle, the necessity of keeping the Invisible
5230	Man from food and sleep, the necessity for incessant watchfulness
5230	and for a prompt attention to any evidence of his movements. And
5230	so swift and decided was the action of the authorities, so prompt
5230	and universal was the belief in this strange being, that before
5230	nightfall an area of several hundred square miles was in a stringent
5230	state of siege. And before nightfall, too, a thrill of horror
5230	went through the whole watching nervous countryside. Going from
5230	whispering mouth to mouth, swift and certain over the length and
5230	breadth of the country, passed the story of the murder of Mr.
5230	Wicksteed.
5230	
5230	If our supposition that the Invisible Man's refuge was the
5230	Hintondean thickets, then we must suppose that in the early
5230	afternoon he sallied out again bent upon some project that involved
5230	the use of a weapon. We cannot know what the project was, but the
5230	evidence that he had the iron rod in hand before he met Wicksteed
5230	is to me at least overwhelming.
5230	
5230	Of course we can know nothing of the details of that encounter.
5230	It occurred on the edge of a gravel pit, not two hundred yards
5230	from Lord Burdock's lodge gate. Everything points to a desperate
5230	struggle--the trampled ground, the numerous wounds Mr. Wicksteed
5230	received, his splintered walking-stick; but why the attack was made,
5230	save in a murderous frenzy, it is impossible to imagine. Indeed the
5230	theory of madness is almost unavoidable. Mr. Wicksteed was a man of
5230	forty-five or forty-six, steward to Lord Burdock, of inoffensive
5230	habits and appearance, the very last person in the world to provoke
5230	such a terrible antagonist. Against him it would seem the Invisible
5230	Man used an iron rod dragged from a broken piece of fence. He
5230	stopped this quiet man, going quietly home to his midday meal,
5230	attacked him, beat down his feeble defences, broke his arm, felled
5230	him, and smashed his head to a jelly.
5230	
5230	Of course, he must have dragged this rod out of the fencing before
5230	he met his victim--he must have been carrying it ready in his hand.
5230	Only two details beyond what has already been stated seem to bear
5230	on the matter. One is the circumstance that the gravel pit was not
5230	in Mr. Wicksteed's direct path home, but nearly a couple of hundred
5230	yards out of his way. The other is the assertion of a little girl
5230	to the effect that, going to her afternoon school, she saw the
5230	murdered man ""trotting"" in a peculiar manner across a field towards
5230	the gravel pit. Her pantomime of his action suggests a man pursuing
5230	something on the ground before him and striking at it ever and
5230	again with his walking-stick. She was the last person to see him
5230	alive. He passed out of her sight to his death, the struggle being
5230	hidden from her only by a clump of beech trees and a slight
5230	depression in the ground.
5230	
5230	Now this, to the present writer's mind at least, lifts the murder
5230	out of the realm of the absolutely wanton. We may imagine that
5230	Griffin had taken the rod as a weapon indeed, but without any
5230	deliberate intention of using it in murder. Wicksteed may then have
5230	come by and noticed this rod inexplicably moving through the air.
5230	Without any thought of the Invisible Man--for Port Burdock is ten
5230	miles away--he may have pursued it. It is quite conceivable that
5230	he may not even have heard of the Invisible Man. One can then
5230	imagine the Invisible Man making off--quietly in order to avoid
5230	discovering his presence in the neighbourhood, and Wicksteed,
5230	excited and curious, pursuing this unaccountably locomotive
5230	object--finally striking at it.
5230	
5230	No doubt the Invisible Man could easily have distanced his
5230	middle-aged pursuer under ordinary circumstances, but the position
5230	in which Wicksteed's body was found suggests that he had the
5230	ill luck to drive his quarry into a corner between a drift of
5230	stinging nettles and the gravel pit. To those who appreciate the
5230	extraordinary irascibility of the Invisible Man, the rest of the
5230	encounter will be easy to imagine.
5230	
5230	But this is pure hypothesis. The only undeniable facts--for stories
5230	of children are often unreliable--are the discovery of Wicksteed's
5230	body, done to death, and of the blood-stained iron rod flung among
5230	the nettles. The abandonment of the rod by Griffin, suggests that
5230	in the emotional excitement of the affair, the purpose for which
5230	he took it--if he had a purpose--was abandoned. He was certainly
5230	an intensely egotistical and unfeeling man, but the sight of his
5230	victim, his first victim, bloody and pitiful at his feet, may have
5230	released some long pent fountain of remorse which for a time may
5230	have flooded whatever scheme of action he had contrived.
5230	
5230	After the murder of Mr. Wicksteed, he would seem to have struck
5230	across the country towards the downland. There is a story of a
5230	voice heard about sunset by a couple of men in a field near Fern
5230	Bottom. It was wailing and laughing, sobbing and groaning, and ever
5230	and again it shouted. It must have been queer hearing. It drove up
5230	across the middle of a clover field and died away towards the
5230	hills.
5230	
5230	That afternoon the Invisible Man must have learnt something of
5230	the rapid use Kemp had made of his confidences. He must have
5230	found houses locked and secured; he may have loitered about
5230	railway stations and prowled about inns, and no doubt he read the
5230	proclamations and realised something of the nature of the campaign
5230	against him. And as the evening advanced, the fields became dotted
5230	here and there with groups of three or four men, and noisy with the
5230	yelping of dogs. These men-hunters had particular instructions in
5230	the case of an encounter as to the way they should support one
5230	another. But he avoided them all. We may understand something of
5230	his exasperation, and it could have been none the less because
5230	he himself had supplied the information that was being used so
5230	remorselessly against him. For that day at least he lost heart; for
5230	nearly twenty-four hours, save when he turned on Wicksteed, he was
5230	a hunted man. In the night, he must have eaten and slept; for in
5230	the morning he was himself again, active, powerful, angry, and
5230	malignant, prepared for his last great struggle against the world.
5230

5230	
5230	CHAPTER XXVII
5230	
5230	THE SIEGE OF KEMP'S HOUSE
5230	
5230	
5230	Kemp read a strange missive, written in pencil on a greasy sheet of
5230	paper.
5230	
5230	""You have been amazingly energetic and clever,"" this letter ran,
5230	""though what you stand to gain by it I cannot imagine. You are
5230	against me. For a whole day you have chased me; you have tried to
5230	rob me of a night's rest. But I have had food in spite of you, I
5230	have slept in spite of you, and the game is only beginning. The
5230	game is only beginning. There is nothing for it, but to start the
5230	Terror. This announces the first day of the Terror. Port Burdock
5230	is no longer under the Queen, tell your Colonel of Police, and
5230	the rest of them; it is under me--the Terror! This is day one of
5230	year one of the new epoch--the Epoch of the Invisible Man. I am
5230	Invisible Man the First. To begin with the rule will be easy. The
5230	first day there will be one execution for the sake of example--a
5230	man named Kemp. Death starts for him to-day. He may lock himself
5230	away, hide himself away, get guards about him, put on armour
5230	if he likes--Death, the unseen Death, is coming. Let him take
5230	precautions; it will impress my people. Death starts from the
5230	pillar box by midday. The letter will fall in as the postman comes
5230	along, then off! The game begins. Death starts. Help him not, my
5230	people, lest Death fall upon you also. To-day Kemp is to die.""
5230	
5230	Kemp read this letter twice, ""It's no hoax,"" he said. ""That's
5230	his voice! And he means it.""
5230	
5230	He turned the folded sheet over and saw on the addressed side of it
5230	the postmark Hintondean, and the prosaic detail ""2d. to pay.""
5230	
5230	He got up slowly, leaving his lunch unfinished--the letter had
5230	come by the one o'clock post--and went into his study. He rang
5230	for his housekeeper, and told her to go round the house at once,
5230	examine all the fastenings of the windows, and close all the
5230	shutters. He closed the shutters of his study himself. From a
5230	locked drawer in his bedroom he took a little revolver, examined it
5230	carefully, and put it into the pocket of his lounge jacket. He
5230	wrote a number of brief notes, one to Colonel Adye, gave them to
5230	his servant to take, with explicit instructions as to her way of
5230	leaving the house. ""There is no danger,"" he said, and added a
5230	mental reservation, ""to you."" He remained meditative for a space
5230	after doing this, and then returned to his cooling lunch.
5230	
5230	He ate with gaps of thought. Finally he struck the table sharply.
5230	""We will have him!"" he said; ""and I am the bait. He will come too
5230	far.""
5230	
5230	He went up to the belvedere, carefully shutting every door after
5230	him. ""It's a game,"" he said, ""an odd game--but the chances are
5230	all for me, Mr. Griffin, in spite of your invisibility. Griffin
5230	_contra mundum_ ... with a vengeance.""
5230	
5230	He stood at the window staring at the hot hillside. ""He must get
5230	food every day--and I don't envy him. Did he really sleep last
5230	night? Out in the open somewhere--secure from collisions. I wish
5230	we could get some good cold wet weather instead of the heat.
5230	
5230	""He may be watching me now.""
5230	
5230	He went close to the window. Something rapped smartly against the
5230	brickwork over the frame, and made him start violently back.
5230	
5230	""I'm getting nervous,"" said Kemp. But it was five minutes before he
5230	went to the window again. ""It must have been a sparrow,"" he said.
5230	
5230	Presently he heard the front-door bell ringing, and hurried
5230	downstairs. He unbolted and unlocked the door, examined the chain,
5230	put it up, and opened cautiously without showing himself. A
5230	familiar voice hailed him. It was Adye.
5230	
5230	""Your servant's been assaulted, Kemp,"" he said round the door.
5230	
5230	""What!"" exclaimed Kemp.
5230	
5230	""Had that note of yours taken away from her. He's close about here.
5230	Let me in.""
5230	
5230	Kemp released the chain, and Adye entered through as narrow an
5230	opening as possible. He stood in the hall, looking with infinite
5230	relief at Kemp refastening the door. ""Note was snatched out of her
5230	hand. Scared her horribly. She's down at the station. Hysterics.
5230	He's close here. What was it about?""
5230	
5230	Kemp swore.
5230	
5230	""What a fool I was,"" said Kemp. ""I might have known. It's not an
5230	hour's walk from Hintondean. Already?""
5230	
5230	""What's up?"" said Adye.
5230	
5230	""Look here!"" said Kemp, and led the way into his study. He handed
5230	Adye the Invisible Man's letter. Adye read it and whistled softly.
5230	""And you--?"" said Adye.
5230	
5230	""Proposed a trap--like a fool,"" said Kemp, ""and sent my proposal
5230	out by a maid servant. To him.""
5230	
5230	Adye followed Kemp's profanity.
5230	
5230	""He'll clear out,"" said Adye.
5230	
5230	""Not he,"" said Kemp.
5230	
5230	A resounding smash of glass came from upstairs. Adye had a silvery
5230	glimpse of a little revolver half out of Kemp's pocket. ""It's a
5230	window, upstairs!"" said Kemp, and led the way up. There came a
5230	second smash while they were still on the staircase. When they
5230	reached the study they found two of the three windows smashed,
5230	half the room littered with splintered glass, and one big flint
5230	lying on the writing table. The two men stopped in the doorway,
5230	contemplating the wreckage. Kemp swore again, and as he did so the
5230	third window went with a snap like a pistol, hung starred for a
5230	moment, and collapsed in jagged, shivering triangles into the room.
5230	
5230	""What's this for?"" said Adye.
5230	
5230	""It's a beginning,"" said Kemp.
5230	
5230	""There's no way of climbing up here?""
5230	
5230	""Not for a cat,"" said Kemp.
5230	
5230	""No shutters?""
5230	
5230	""Not here. All the downstairs rooms--Hullo!""
5230	
5230	Smash, and then whack of boards hit hard came from downstairs.
5230	""Confound him!"" said Kemp. ""That must be--yes--it's one of the
5230	bedrooms. He's going to do all the house. But he's a fool. The
5230	shutters are up, and the glass will fall outside. He'll cut his
5230	feet.""
5230	
5230	Another window proclaimed its destruction. The two men stood on the
5230	landing perplexed. ""I have it!"" said Adye. ""Let me have a stick or
5230	something, and I'll go down to the station and get the bloodhounds
5230	put on. That ought to settle him! They're hard by--not ten
5230	minutes--""
5230	
5230	Another window went the way of its fellows.
5230	
5230	""You haven't a revolver?"" asked Adye.
5230	
5230	Kemp's hand went to his pocket. Then he hesitated. ""I haven't
5230	one--at least to spare.""
5230	
5230	""I'll bring it back,"" said Adye, ""you'll be safe here.""
5230	
5230	Kemp, ashamed of his momentary lapse from truthfulness, handed him
5230	the weapon.
5230	
5230	""Now for the door,"" said Adye.
5230	
5230	As they stood hesitating in the hall, they heard one of the
5230	first-floor bedroom windows crack and clash. Kemp went to the door
5230	and began to slip the bolts as silently as possible. His face was a
5230	little paler than usual. ""You must step straight out,"" said Kemp. In
5230	another moment Adye was on the doorstep and the bolts were dropping
5230	back into the staples. He hesitated for a moment, feeling more
5230	comfortable with his back against the door. Then he marched, upright
5230	and square, down the steps. He crossed the lawn and approached the
5230	gate. A little breeze seemed to ripple over the grass. Something
5230	moved near him. ""Stop a bit,"" said a Voice, and Adye stopped dead
5230	and his hand tightened on the revolver.
5230	
5230	""Well?"" said Adye, white and grim, and every nerve tense.
5230	
5230	""Oblige me by going back to the house,"" said the Voice, as tense
5230	and grim as Adye's.
5230	
5230	""Sorry,"" said Adye a little hoarsely, and moistened his lips with
5230	his tongue. The Voice was on his left front, he thought. Suppose he
5230	were to take his luck with a shot?
5230	
5230	""What are you going for?"" said the Voice, and there was a quick
5230	movement of the two, and a flash of sunlight from the open lip of
5230	Adye's pocket.
5230	
5230	Adye desisted and thought. ""Where I go,"" he said slowly, ""is my own
5230	business."" The words were still on his lips, when an arm came round
5230	his neck, his back felt a knee, and he was sprawling backward. He
5230	drew clumsily and fired absurdly, and in another moment he was
5230	struck in the mouth and the revolver wrested from his grip. He made
5230	a vain clutch at a slippery limb, tried to struggle up and fell
5230	back. ""Damn!"" said Adye. The Voice laughed. ""I'd kill you now if it
5230	wasn't the waste of a bullet,"" it said. He saw the revolver in
5230	mid-air, six feet off, covering him.
5230	
5230	""Well?"" said Adye, sitting up.
5230	
5230	""Get up,"" said the Voice.
5230	
5230	Adye stood up.
5230	
5230	""Attention,"" said the Voice, and then fiercely, ""Don't try any
5230	games. Remember I can see your face if you can't see mine. You've
5230	got to go back to the house.""
5230	
5230	""He won't let me in,"" said Adye.
5230	
5230	""That's a pity,"" said the Invisible Man. ""I've got no quarrel with
5230	you.""
5230	
5230	Adye moistened his lips again. He glanced away from the barrel of
5230	the revolver and saw the sea far off very blue and dark under the
5230	midday sun, the smooth green down, the white cliff of the Head, and
5230	the multitudinous town, and suddenly he knew that life was very
5230	sweet. His eyes came back to this little metal thing hanging
5230	between heaven and earth, six yards away. ""What am I to do?"" he
5230	said sullenly.
5230	
5230	""What am _I_ to do?"" asked the Invisible Man. ""You will get help. The
5230	only thing is for you to go back.""
5230	
5230	""I will try. If he lets me in will you promise not to rush the
5230	door?""
5230	
5230	""I've got no quarrel with you,"" said the Voice.
5230	
5230	Kemp had hurried upstairs after letting Adye out, and now crouching
5230	among the broken glass and peering cautiously over the edge of the
5230	study window sill, he saw Adye stand parleying with the Unseen.
5230	""Why doesn't he fire?"" whispered Kemp to himself. Then the revolver
5230	moved a little and the glint of the sunlight flashed in Kemp's
5230	eyes. He shaded his eyes and tried to see the source of the
5230	blinding beam.
5230	
5230	""Surely!"" he said, ""Adye has given up the revolver.""
5230	
5230	""Promise not to rush the door,"" Adye was saying. ""Don't push a
5230	winning game too far. Give a man a chance.""
5230	
5230	""You go back to the house. I tell you flatly I will not promise
5230	anything.""
5230	
5230	Adye's decision seemed suddenly made. He turned towards the house,
5230	walking slowly with his hands behind him. Kemp watched him--puzzled.
5230	The revolver vanished, flashed again into sight, vanished again,
5230	and became evident on a closer scrutiny as a little dark object
5230	following Adye. Then things happened very quickly. Adye leapt
5230	backwards, swung around, clutched at this little object, missed it,
5230	threw up his hands and fell forward on his face, leaving a little
5230	puff of blue in the air. Kemp did not hear the sound of the shot.
5230	Adye writhed, raised himself on one arm, fell forward, and lay
5230	still.
5230	
5230	For a space Kemp remained staring at the quiet carelessness of
5230	Adye's attitude. The afternoon was very hot and still, nothing
5230	seemed stirring in all the world save a couple of yellow butterflies
5230	chasing each other through the shrubbery between the house and the
5230	road gate. Adye lay on the lawn near the gate. The blinds of all
5230	the villas down the hill-road were drawn, but in one little green
5230	summer-house was a white figure, apparently an old man asleep. Kemp
5230	scrutinised the surroundings of the house for a glimpse of the
5230	revolver, but it had vanished. His eyes came back to Adye. The game
5230	was opening well.
5230	
5230	Then came a ringing and knocking at the front door, that grew at
5230	last tumultuous, but pursuant to Kemp's instructions the servants
5230	had locked themselves into their rooms. This was followed by a
5230	silence. Kemp sat listening and then began peering cautiously out
5230	of the three windows, one after another. He went to the staircase
5230	head and stood listening uneasily. He armed himself with his
5230	bedroom poker, and went to examine the interior fastenings of the
5230	ground-floor windows again. Everything was safe and quiet. He
5230	returned to the belvedere. Adye lay motionless over the edge of the
5230	gravel just as he had fallen. Coming along the road by the villas
5230	were the housemaid and two policemen.
5230	
5230	Everything was deadly still. The three people seemed very slow in
5230	approaching. He wondered what his antagonist was doing.
5230	
5230	He started. There was a smash from below. He hesitated and went
5230	downstairs again. Suddenly the house resounded with heavy blows and
5230	the splintering of wood. He heard a smash and the destructive clang
5230	of the iron fastenings of the shutters. He turned the key and
5230	opened the kitchen door. As he did so, the shutters, split and
5230	splintering, came flying inward. He stood aghast. The window frame,
5230	save for one crossbar, was still intact, but only little teeth of
5230	glass remained in the frame. The shutters had been driven in with
5230	an axe, and now the axe was descending in sweeping blows upon the
5230	window frame and the iron bars defending it. Then suddenly it leapt
5230	aside and vanished. He saw the revolver lying on the path outside,
5230	and then the little weapon sprang into the air. He dodged back. The
5230	revolver cracked just too late, and a splinter from the edge of the
5230	closing door flashed over his head. He slammed and locked the door,
5230	and as he stood outside he heard Griffin shouting and laughing.
5230	Then the blows of the axe with its splitting and smashing
5230	consequences, were resumed.
5230	
5230	Kemp stood in the passage trying to think. In a moment the
5230	Invisible Man would be in the kitchen. This door would not keep him
5230	a moment, and then--
5230	
5230	A ringing came at the front door again. It would be the policemen.
5230	He ran into the hall, put up the chain, and drew the bolts. He made
5230	the girl speak before he dropped the chain, and the three people
5230	blundered into the house in a heap, and Kemp slammed the door
5230	again.
5230	
5230	""The Invisible Man!"" said Kemp. ""He has a revolver, with two
5230	shots--left. He's killed Adye. Shot him anyhow. Didn't you see him on
5230	the lawn? He's lying there.""
5230	
5230	""Who?"" said one of the policemen.
5230	
5230	""Adye,"" said Kemp.
5230	
5230	""We came in the back way,"" said the girl.
5230	
5230	""What's that smashing?"" asked one of the policemen.
5230	
5230	""He's in the kitchen--or will be. He has found an axe--""
5230	
5230	Suddenly the house was full of the Invisible Man's resounding
5230	blows on the kitchen door. The girl stared towards the kitchen,
5230	shuddered, and retreated into the dining-room. Kemp tried to
5230	explain in broken sentences. They heard the kitchen door give.
5230	
5230	""This way,"" said Kemp, starting into activity, and bundled the
5230	policemen into the dining-room doorway.
5230	
5230	""Poker,"" said Kemp, and rushed to the fender. He handed the poker
5230	he had carried to the policeman and the dining-room one to the
5230	other. He suddenly flung himself backward.
5230	
5230	""Whup!"" said one policeman, ducked, and caught the axe on his poker.
5230	The pistol snapped its penultimate shot and ripped a valuable Sidney
5230	Cooper. The second policeman brought his poker down on the little
5230	weapon, as one might knock down a wasp, and sent it rattling to the
5230	floor.
5230	
5230	At the first clash the girl screamed, stood screaming for a moment
5230	by the fireplace, and then ran to open the shutters--possibly
5230	with an idea of escaping by the shattered window.
5230	
5230	The axe receded into the passage, and fell to a position about two
5230	feet from the ground. They could hear the Invisible Man breathing.
5230	""Stand away, you two,"" he said. ""I want that man Kemp.""
5230	
5230	""We want you,"" said the first policeman, making a quick step
5230	forward and wiping with his poker at the Voice. The Invisible Man
5230	must have started back, and he blundered into the umbrella stand.
5230	
5230	Then, as the policeman staggered with the swing of the blow he had
5230	aimed, the Invisible Man countered with the axe, the helmet crumpled
5230	like paper, and the blow sent the man spinning to the floor at the
5230	head of the kitchen stairs. But the second policeman, aiming behind
5230	the axe with his poker, hit something soft that snapped. There was a
5230	sharp exclamation of pain and then the axe fell to the ground. The
5230	policeman wiped again at vacancy and hit nothing; he put his foot on
5230	the axe, and struck again. Then he stood, poker clubbed, listening
5230	intent for the slightest movement.
5230	
5230	He heard the dining-room window open, and a quick rush of feet
5230	within. His companion rolled over and sat up, with the blood
5230	running down between his eye and ear. ""Where is he?"" asked the man
5230	on the floor.
5230	
5230	""Don't know. I've hit him. He's standing somewhere in the hall.
5230	Unless he's slipped past you. Doctor Kemp--sir.""
5230	
5230	Pause.
5230	
5230	""Doctor Kemp,"" cried the policeman again.
5230	
5230	The second policeman began struggling to his feet. He stood up.
5230	Suddenly the faint pad of bare feet on the kitchen stairs could be
5230	heard. ""Yap!"" cried the first policeman, and incontinently flung
5230	his poker. It smashed a little gas bracket.
5230	
5230	He made as if he would pursue the Invisible Man downstairs. Then he
5230	thought better of it and stepped into the dining-room.
5230	
5230	""Doctor Kemp--"" he began, and stopped short.
5230	
5230	""Doctor Kemp's a hero,"" he said, as his companion looked over his
5230	shoulder.
5230	
5230	The dining-room window was wide open, and neither housemaid nor
5230	Kemp was to be seen.
5230	
5230	The second policeman's opinion of Kemp was terse and vivid.
5230	
5230	
5230	
5230	CHAPTER XXVIII
5230	
5230	THE HUNTER HUNTED
5230	
5230	
5230	Mr. Heelas, Mr. Kemp's nearest neighbour among the villa holders,
5230	was asleep in his summer house when the siege of Kemp's house
5230	began. Mr. Heelas was one of the sturdy minority who refused to
5230	believe ""in all this nonsense"" about an Invisible Man. His wife,
5230	however, as he was subsequently to be reminded, did. He insisted
5230	upon walking about his garden just as if nothing was the matter,
5230	and he went to sleep in the afternoon in accordance with the custom
5230	of years. He slept through the smashing of the windows, and then
5230	woke up suddenly with a curious persuasion of something wrong. He
5230	looked across at Kemp's house, rubbed his eyes and looked again.
5230	Then he put his feet to the ground, and sat listening. He said he
5230	was damned, but still the strange thing was visible. The house
5230	looked as though it had been deserted for weeks--after a violent
5230	riot. Every window was broken, and every window, save those of the
5230	belvedere study, was blinded by the internal shutters.
5230	
5230	""I could have sworn it was all right""--he looked at his watch--""twenty
5230	minutes ago.""
5230	
5230	He became aware of a measured concussion and the clash of glass,
5230	far away in the distance. And then, as he sat open-mouthed, came a
5230	still more wonderful thing. The shutters of the drawing-room window
5230	were flung open violently, and the housemaid in her outdoor hat and
5230	garments, appeared struggling in a frantic manner to throw up the
5230	sash. Suddenly a man appeared beside her, helping her--Dr. Kemp!
5230	In another moment the window was open, and the housemaid was
5230	struggling out; she pitched forward and vanished among the shrubs.
5230	Mr. Heelas stood up, exclaiming vaguely and vehemently at all these
5230	wonderful things. He saw Kemp stand on the sill, spring from the
5230	window, and reappear almost instantaneously running along a path in
5230	the shrubbery and stooping as he ran, like a man who evades
5230	observation. He vanished behind a laburnum, and appeared again
5230	clambering over a fence that abutted on the open down. In a second
5230	he had tumbled over and was running at a tremendous pace down the
5230	slope towards Mr. Heelas.
5230	
5230	""Lord!"" cried Mr. Heelas, struck with an idea; ""it's that Invisible
5230	Man brute! It's right, after all!""
5230	
5230	With Mr. Heelas to think things like that was to act, and his cook
5230	watching him from the top window was amazed to see him come pelting
5230	towards the house at a good nine miles an hour. There was a
5230	slamming of doors, a ringing of bells, and the voice of Mr. Heelas
5230	bellowing like a bull. ""Shut the doors, shut the windows, shut
5230	everything!--the Invisible Man is coming!"" Instantly the house was
5230	full of screams and directions, and scurrying feet. He ran himself
5230	to shut the French windows that opened on the veranda; as he did so
5230	Kemp's head and shoulders and knee appeared over the edge of the
5230	garden fence. In another moment Kemp had ploughed through the
5230	asparagus, and was running across the tennis lawn to the house.
5230	
5230	""You can't come in,"" said Mr. Heelas, shutting the bolts. ""I'm very
5230	sorry if he's after you, but you can't come in!""
5230	
5230	Kemp appeared with a face of terror close to the glass, rapping and
5230	then shaking frantically at the French window. Then, seeing his
5230	efforts were useless, he ran along the veranda, vaulted the end,
5230	and went to hammer at the side door. Then he ran round by the side
5230	gate to the front of the house, and so into the hill-road. And Mr.
5230	Heelas staring from his window--a face of horror--had scarcely
5230	witnessed Kemp vanish, ere the asparagus was being trampled this
5230	way and that by feet unseen. At that Mr. Heelas fled precipitately
5230	upstairs, and the rest of the chase is beyond his purview. But as
5230	he passed the staircase window, he heard the side gate slam.
5230	
5230	Emerging into the hill-road, Kemp naturally took the downward
5230	direction, and so it was he came to run in his own person the very
5230	race he had watched with such a critical eye from the belvedere
5230	study only four days ago. He ran it well, for a man out of
5230	training, and though his face was white and wet, his wits were cool
5230	to the last. He ran with wide strides, and wherever a patch of
5230	rough ground intervened, wherever there came a patch of raw flints,
5230	or a bit of broken glass shone dazzling, he crossed it and left the
5230	bare invisible feet that followed to take what line they would.
5230	
5230	For the first time in his life Kemp discovered that the hill-road
5230	was indescribably vast and desolate, and that the beginnings of the
5230	town far below at the hill foot were strangely remote. Never had
5230	there been a slower or more painful method of progression than
5230	running. All the gaunt villas, sleeping in the afternoon sun,
5230	looked locked and barred; no doubt they were locked and barred--by
5230	his own orders. But at any rate they might have kept a lookout
5230	for an eventuality like this! The town was rising up now, the sea
5230	had dropped out of sight behind it, and people down below were
5230	stirring. A tram was just arriving at the hill foot. Beyond that
5230	was the police station. Was that footsteps he heard behind him?
5230	Spurt.
5230	
5230	The people below were staring at him, one or two were running, and
5230	his breath was beginning to saw in his throat. The tram was quite
5230	near now, and the ""Jolly Cricketers"" was noisily barring its doors.
5230	Beyond the tram were posts and heaps of gravel--the drainage
5230	works. He had a transitory idea of jumping into the tram and
5230	slamming the doors, and then he resolved to go for the police
5230	station. In another moment he had passed the door of the ""Jolly
5230	Cricketers,"" and was in the blistering fag end of the street, with
5230	human beings about him. The tram driver and his helper--arrested
5230	by the sight of his furious haste--stood staring with the tram
5230	horses unhitched. Further on the astonished features of navvies
5230	appeared above the mounds of gravel.
5230	
5230	His pace broke a little, and then he heard the swift pad of his
5230	pursuer, and leapt forward again. ""The Invisible Man!"" he cried to
5230	the navvies, with a vague indicative gesture, and by an inspiration
5230	leapt the excavation and placed a burly group between him and the
5230	chase. Then abandoning the idea of the police station he turned
5230	into a little side street, rushed by a greengrocer's cart,
5230	hesitated for the tenth of a second at the door of a sweetstuff
5230	shop, and then made for the mouth of an alley that ran back into
5230	the main Hill Street again. Two or three little children were
5230	playing here, and shrieked and scattered at his apparition, and
5230	forthwith doors and windows opened and excited mothers revealed
5230	their hearts. Out he shot into Hill Street again, three hundred
5230	yards from the tram-line end, and immediately he became aware of a
5230	tumultuous vociferation and running people.
5230	
5230	He glanced up the street towards the hill. Hardly a dozen yards off
5230	ran a huge navvy, cursing in fragments and slashing viciously with
5230	a spade, and hard behind him came the tram conductor with his fists
5230	clenched. Up the street others followed these two, striking and
5230	shouting. Down towards the town, men and women were running, and he
5230	noticed clearly one man coming out of a shop-door with a stick in
5230	his hand. ""Spread out! Spread out!"" cried some one. Kemp suddenly
5230	grasped the altered condition of the chase. He stopped, and looked
5230	round, panting. ""He's close here!"" he cried. ""Form a line across--""
5230	
5230	He was hit hard under the ear, and went reeling, trying to face
5230	round towards his unseen antagonist. He just managed to keep his
5230	feet, and he struck a vain counter in the air. Then he was hit
5230	again under the jaw, and sprawled headlong on the ground. In
5230	another moment a knee compressed his diaphragm, and a couple of
5230	eager hands gripped his throat, but the grip of one was weaker than
5230	the other; he grasped the wrists, heard a cry of pain from his
5230	assailant, and then the spade of the navvy came whirling through
5230	the air above him, and struck something with a dull thud. He felt
5230	a drop of moisture on his face. The grip at his throat suddenly
5230	relaxed, and with a convulsive effort, Kemp loosed himself, grasped
5230	a limp shoulder, and rolled uppermost. He gripped the unseen elbows
5230	near the ground. ""I've got him!"" screamed Kemp. ""Help! Help--hold!
5230	He's down! Hold his feet!""
5230	
5230	In another second there was a simultaneous rush upon the struggle,
5230	and a stranger coming into the road suddenly might have thought an
5230	exceptionally savage game of Rugby football was in progress. And
5230	there was no shouting after Kemp's cry--only a sound of blows
5230	and feet and heavy breathing.
5230	
5230	Then came a mighty effort, and the Invisible Man threw off a couple
5230	of his antagonists and rose to his knees. Kemp clung to him in
5230	front like a hound to a stag, and a dozen hands gripped, clutched,
5230	and tore at the Unseen. The tram conductor suddenly got the neck
5230	and shoulders and lugged him back.
5230	
5230	Down went the heap of struggling men again and rolled over. There
5230	was, I am afraid, some savage kicking. Then suddenly a wild scream
5230	of ""Mercy! Mercy!"" that died down swiftly to a sound like choking.
5230	
5230	""Get back, you fools!"" cried the muffled voice of Kemp, and there
5230	was a vigorous shoving back of stalwart forms. ""He's hurt, I tell
5230	you. Stand back!""
5230	
5230	There was a brief struggle to clear a space, and then the circle of
5230	eager faces saw the doctor kneeling, as it seemed, fifteen inches
5230	in the air, and holding invisible arms to the ground. Behind him a
5230	constable gripped invisible ankles.
5230	
5230	""Don't you leave go of en,"" cried the big navvy, holding a
5230	blood-stained spade; ""he's shamming.""
5230	
5230	""He's not shamming,"" said the doctor, cautiously raising his knee;
5230	""and I'll hold him."" His face was bruised and already going red; he
5230	spoke thickly because of a bleeding lip. He released one hand and
5230	seemed to be feeling at the face. ""The mouth's all wet,"" he said.
5230	And then, ""Good God!""
5230	
5230	He stood up abruptly and then knelt down on the ground by the side
5230	of the thing unseen. There was a pushing and shuffling, a sound of
5230	heavy feet as fresh people turned up to increase the pressure of
5230	the crowd. People now were coming out of the houses. The doors of
5230	the ""Jolly Cricketers"" stood suddenly wide open. Very little was said.
5230	
5230	Kemp felt about, his hand seeming to pass through empty air. ""He's
5230	not breathing,"" he said, and then, ""I can't feel his heart. His
5230	side--ugh!""
5230	
5230	Suddenly an old woman, peering under the arm of the big navvy,
5230	screamed sharply. ""Looky there!"" she said, and thrust out a
5230	wrinkled finger.
5230	
5230	And looking where she pointed, everyone saw, faint and transparent
5230	as though it was made of glass, so that veins and arteries and
5230	bones and nerves could be distinguished, the outline of a hand, a
5230	hand limp and prone. It grew clouded and opaque even as they stared.
5230	
5230	""Hullo!"" cried the constable. ""Here's his feet a-showing!""
5230	
5230	And so, slowly, beginning at his hands and feet and creeping along
5230	his limbs to the vital centres of his body, that strange change
5230	continued. It was like the slow spreading of a poison. First came
5230	the little white nerves, a hazy grey sketch of a limb, then the
5230	glassy bones and intricate arteries, then the flesh and skin, first
5230	a faint fogginess, and then growing rapidly dense and opaque.
5230	Presently they could see his crushed chest and his shoulders, and
5230	the dim outline of his drawn and battered features.
5230	
5230	When at last the crowd made way for Kemp to stand erect, there lay,
5230	naked and pitiful on the ground, the bruised and broken body of a
5230	young man about thirty. His hair and brow were white--not grey
5230	with age, but white with the whiteness of albinism--and his eyes
5230	were like garnets. His hands were clenched, his eyes wide open, and
5230	his expression was one of anger and dismay.
5230	
5230	""Cover his face!"" said a man. ""For Gawd's sake, cover that face!""
5230	and three little children, pushing forward through the crowd, were
5230	suddenly twisted round and sent packing off again.
5230	
5230	Someone brought a sheet from the ""Jolly Cricketers,"" and having
5230	covered him, they carried him into that house. And there it was, on
5230	a shabby bed in a tawdry, ill-lighted bedroom, surrounded by a crowd
5230	of ignorant and excited people, broken and wounded, betrayed and
5230	unpitied, that Griffin, the first of all men to make himself
5230	invisible, Griffin, the most gifted physicist the world has ever
5230	seen, ended in infinite disaster his strange and terrible career.
5230	
5230	
5230	
5230	THE EPILOGUE
5230	
5230	
5230	So ends the story of the strange and evil experiments of the
5230	Invisible Man. And if you would learn more of him you must go to a
5230	little inn near Port Stowe and talk to the landlord. The sign of
5230	the inn is an empty board save for a hat and boots, and the name is
5230	the title of this story. The landlord is a short and corpulent
5230	little man with a nose of cylindrical proportions, wiry hair, and a
5230	sporadic rosiness of visage. Drink generously, and he will tell you
5230	generously of all the things that happened to him after that time,
5230	and of how the lawyers tried to do him out of the treasure found
5230	upon him.
5230	
5230	""When they found they couldn't prove whose money was which, I'm
5230	blessed,"" he says, ""if they didn't try to make me out a blooming
5230	treasure trove! Do I _look_ like a Treasure Trove? And then a
5230	gentleman gave me a guinea a night to tell the story at the Empire
5230	Music 'All--just to tell 'em in my own words--barring one.""
5230	
5230	And if you want to cut off the flow of his reminiscences abruptly,
5230	you can always do so by asking if there weren't three manuscript
5230	books in the story. He admits there were and proceeds to explain,
5230	with asseverations that everybody thinks _he_ has 'em! But bless you!
5230	he hasn't. ""The Invisible Man it was took 'em off to hide 'em when
5230	I cut and ran for Port Stowe. It's that Mr. Kemp put people on with
5230	the idea of _my_ having 'em.""
5230	
5230	And then he subsides into a pensive state, watches you furtively,
5230	bustles nervously with glasses, and presently leaves the bar.
5230	
5230	He is a bachelor man--his tastes were ever bachelor, and there
5230	are no women folk in the house. Outwardly he buttons--it is
5230	expected of him--but in his more vital privacies, in the matter
5230	of braces for example, he still turns to string. He conducts his
5230	house without enterprise, but with eminent decorum. His movements
5230	are slow, and he is a great thinker. But he has a reputation for
5230	wisdom and for a respectable parsimony in the village, and his
5230	knowledge of the roads of the South of England would beat Cobbett.
5230	
5230	And on Sunday mornings, every Sunday morning, all the year round,
5230	while he is closed to the outer world, and every night after ten,
5230	he goes into his bar parlour, bearing a glass of gin faintly tinged
5230	with water, and having placed this down, he locks the door and
5230	examines the blinds, and even looks under the table. And then,
5230	being satisfied of his solitude, he unlocks the cupboard and a box
5230	in the cupboard and a drawer in that box, and produces three
5230	volumes bound in brown leather, and places them solemnly in the
5230	middle of the table. The covers are weather-worn and tinged with an
5230	algal green--for once they sojourned in a ditch and some of the
5230	pages have been washed blank by dirty water. The landlord sits down
5230	in an armchair, fills a long clay pipe slowly--gloating over the
5230	books the while. Then he pulls one towards him and opens it, and
5230	begins to study it--turning over the leaves backwards and forwards.
5230	
5230	His brows are knit and his lips move painfully. ""Hex, little two up
5230	in the air, cross and a fiddle-de-dee. Lord! what a one he was for
5230	intellect!""
5230	
5230	Presently he relaxes and leans back, and blinks through his smoke
5230	across the room at things invisible to other eyes. ""Full of
5230	secrets,"" he says. ""Wonderful secrets!""
5230	
5230	""Once I get the haul of them--_Lord_!""
5230	
5230	""I wouldn't do what _he_ did; I'd just--well!"" He pulls at his
5230	pipe.
5230	
5230	So he lapses into a dream, the undying wonderful dream of his life.
5230	And though Kemp has fished unceasingly, no human being save the
5230	landlord knows those books are there, with the subtle secret of
5230	invisibility and a dozen other strange secrets written therein.
5230	And none other will know of them until he dies.
