# 2D representation of centered linear regression.

# Draw oblique (mother, son) axes at angle theta_ms, 
# where cos(theta_ms) = cor(m, s.)
# Draw grid-lines parallel to the axes.

# "Oms": the oblique coordinate system
# "Xms": the Cartesian coordinate system 

# Represent the column vector of mothers' heights as a
# _unit_ vector: Oms(1, 0) = Xms(1, 0).

# Represent the column vector of sons' heights as a
# _unit_ vector: Oms(0, 1) = Xms(cos(theta_ms), sin(theta_ms)).

# Oms(a, b) represents the vector given by the linear combination
# a*m + b*s.  The plotting limits must accommodate all convex 
# combinations Oms(t, 1-t), for 0 <= t <= 1.
